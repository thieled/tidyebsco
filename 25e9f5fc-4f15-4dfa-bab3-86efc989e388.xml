        <ab>Twitter social media has been emerging as one of the most admired channels for sharing news and opinions. A tweet once posted becomes noteworthy after it gets a high number of positive responses from other people in the form of retweets sharing the same medium. The number of retweets a tweet gets is an alternative metric for positive affirmations received from the crowd-sourced medium. The rise in the number of retweets helps in not making a topic trending but also helps the tweet getting broadcasted. Similarly, a high number of followers gained by a user increases his social presence in the online ecosystem. Both these metrics influence the popularity of the user to a great extent. Users who are interested in bolstering their tweets contact merchants of black-marketing services and become part of this dark web community. They get engaged in these collusive activities to get a high number of followers or retweets instantly. These users are genuine, showing a blend of human and automated behavior. In our proposed collusion defection model, C-ANN, we have attempted to build a framework that can detect collusive users with a maximum accuracy of 94% using multiple basic and derived attributes based on user profile and activity.</ab>

        <ab>The crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the decree of the State of Alarm in Spain and a severe home confinement that was softened in phases of de-escalation. During this period, social networks were used as a discussion tool. With this research we intend to find out if artificial intelligence tools were used in the political debate on Twitter. To achieve this, algorithms that determine the presence of bots in the conversation, their communicative roles and their relationship with the main political parties were applied. The results show that disinformation campaigns were created by bots with the aim of manipulating public opinion.</ab>

        <ab>This article reflects on the conceptualization and the salient features of the ecology of e-democracy. The authors identify four distinct waves marked by technological innovations and studied under the control--participation dichotomy. In the first wave, during the 1990s, political actors begin to establish their online presence but without any other notable changes in communication. The second wave takes place from 2004 to 2008 and features the consolidation of social networks and the increasing commodification of audience engagement. The third wave begins to take shape during Obama's 2008 election campaign, which featured micro-segmentation and the use of big data. The fourth wave, starting in 2016 with the Brexit campaign and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, has been defined by the front and center use of Artificial Intelligence. Some recent phenomena that challenge or buttress the make-up of critical public opinion are the following: a) digital platforms as political actors; b) the marked use of Artificial Intelligence and big data; c) the use of falsehoods as a political strategy, as well as other fake news and deep fake phenomena; d) the combination of hyperlocal and supranational issues; e) technological determinism; f) the search for audience engagement and co-production processes; and g) trends that threaten democracy, to wit, the polarization of opinions, astroturfing, echo chambers and bubble filters. Finally, the authors identify several challenges in research, pedagogy and politics that could strengthen democratic values, and conclude that democracy needs to be reimagined both under new research and political action frameworks, as well as through the creation of a social imaginary on democracy.</ab>

        <ab>Collective user behavior in social media applications often drives several important online and offline phenomena linked to the spread of opinions and information. Several studies have focused on the analysis of such phenomena using networks to model user interactions, represented by edges. However, only a fraction of edges contribute to the actual investigation. Even worse, the often large number of non-relevant edges may obfuscate the salient interactions, blurring the underlying structures and user communities that capture the collective behavior patterns driving the target phenomenon. To solve this issue, researchers have proposed several network backbone extraction techniques to obtain a reduced and representative version of the network that better explains the phenomenon of interest. Each technique has its specific assumptions and procedure to extract the backbone. However, the literature lacks a clear methodology to highlight such assumptions, discuss how they affect the choice of a method and offer validation strategies in scenarios where no ground truth exists. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a principled methodology for comparing and selecting the most appropriate backbone extraction method given a phenomenon of interest. We characterize ten state-of-the-art techniques in terms of their assumptions, requirements, and other aspects that one must consider to apply them in practice. We present four steps to apply, evaluate and select the best method(s) to a given target phenomenon. We validate our approach using two case studies with different requirements: online discussions on Instagram and coordinated behavior in WhatsApp groups. We show that each method can produce very different backbones, underlying that the choice of an adequate method is of utmost importance to reveal valuable knowledge about the particular phenomenon under investigation.</ab>

        <ab>The rise of social media accompanied by the Covid-19 Pandemic has instigated a shift in paradigm in the presidential campaigns in Iran from the real world to social media. Unlike previous presidential elections, there was a decrease in physical events and advertisements for the candidates; in turn, the online presence of presidential candidates is significantly increased. Farsi Twitter played a specific role in this matter, as it became the platform for creating political content. In this study, we found traces of organizational activities in Farsi Twitter, and our investigations reveal that the discussion network of the 2021 election is heterogeneous and highly polarized. However, unlike many other documented election cases in Iran and around the globe, communities of candidates' supporters are very close in one pole, and the other pole is for "Anti-voters" who endorse boycotting the election. With almost no reciprocal ties, these two poles form two echo chambers, one favoring the election and the other for voter suppression. Furthermore, a high presence of bot activity is observed among the most influential users in all of the involved communities.</ab>

        <ab>The contexts of social and political polarization are generating new forms of communication that affect the digital public sphere. In these environments, different social and political actors contribute to extreme their positions, using bots to create spaces for social distancing where hate speech and incivility have a place, a phenomenon that worries scientists and experts. The main objective of this research is to analyze the role that these automated agents played in the debate on social networks about the Spanish Government's management of the global COVID-19 pandemic. For this, "'Social Big Data Analysis" techniques were applied: machine learning algorithms to know the positioning of users; bot detection algorithms; "topic modeling" techniques to learn about the topics of the debate on the web, and sentiment analysis. We used a database comprised of Twitter messages published during the confinement, as a result of the Spanish state of alarm. The main conclusion is that the bots could have served to design a political propaganda campaign initiated by traditional actors with the aim of increasing tension in an environment of social emergency. It is argued that, although these agents are not the only actors that increase polarization, they do contribute to deepening the debate on certain key issues, increasing negativity.</ab>

        <ab>Attempts to manipulate public opinion using social media and emerging information communication technologies (ICTs) continue to proliferate internationally. Governments, corporations, extremist groups, and a wide variety of other entities around the globe now commonly use both automated bots and anonymous human "sockpuppet" accounts in efforts to amplify and suppress particular streams of information during elections, security crises, and other pivotal events. They use these same tools to sow disinformation and engage in organized political trolling campaigns. However, the technologies and tactics used in these internet-based "influence operations" are changing. This essay leverages insights from over 70 interviews with people who both produce and track online manipulation campaigns. It compares emerging trends in digital disinformation and computational propaganda across the globe using qualitative data from 12 countries—Burma, Brazil, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States. In essence, internet-borne manipulation efforts are evolving from relatively unsophisticated "inorganic" campaigns pushed by social media bots and towards more complex "semi-organic" efforts combining both coordinated human users and artificial intelligence software. Additional, related, trends include the increased coercive political use of social media influencers and encrypted and private messaging applications.</ab>

        <ab>Online political astroturfing—hidden information campaigns in which a political actor mimics genuine citizen behavior by incentivizing agents to spread information online—has become prevalent on social media. Such inauthentic information campaigns threaten to undermine the Internet's promise to more equitable participation in public debates. We argue that the logic of social behavior within the campaign bureaucracy and principal–agent problems lead to detectable activity patterns among the campaign's social media accounts. Our analysis uses a network-based methodology to identify such coordination patterns in all campaigns contained in the largest publicly available database on astroturfing published by Twitter. On average, 74% of the involved accounts in each campaign engaged in a simple form of coordination that we call co-tweeting and co-retweeting. Comparing the astroturfing accounts to various systematically constructed comparison samples, we show that the same behavior is negligible among the accounts of regular users that the campaigns try to mimic. As its main substantive contribution, the paper demonstrates that online political astroturfing consistently leaves similar traces of coordination, even across diverse political and country contexts and different time periods. The presented methodology is a reliable first step for detecting astroturfing campaigns.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we reveal the understudied transnational dimensions of politically manipulative activity on social media. Specifically, we identify and investigate a bot-like Twitter network associated with the controversial organization of Iranian political exiles, the Mojaheddin-e Khalgh (MEK). Tracing and contextualizing the Twitter debate around women's rights within the 2016 Iranian Parliamentary election, our analysis contributes to the scholarship on diaspora and digital media by drawing attention to the often-neglected potentials for non-state actors such as diaspora groups to make use of social media to promote political propaganda that advances militarist violence. We demonstrate how the MEK network's "online performance of civic participation" is typical of a bot-net of weak influence inside Iran, but that the aims and extent of its influence can only be fully understood by situating it within a historical and transnational analysis of Iranian diasporic media and politics, one that takes complex US-Iran diplomacy dynamics into consideration.</ab>

        <ab>The Russia-Ukrainian war has led to a large disinformation campaign, largely spread through social media. Canada has been a target of these influence campaigns to affect Canadian public opinions. In this policy brief, we venture to examine the prevalence of pro-Russian narratives on Canadian social media as well as identify major influencers creating and spreading such narratives. Additionally, using artificial intelligence, we seek to examine the reach and nature of pro-Russian disinformation narratives. Our research team has been collecting more than 6.2 million Tweets globally since January 2022 to monitor and measure Russian influence operations on social media. We find that pro-Russian narratives promoted in the Canadian social media ecosystem on twitter are divided into two large communities: 1) accounts influenced by sources from the United States and 2) those largely influenced by sources from international sources from Russia, Europe, and China. First, pro-Russian discourse on Canadian Twitter blames NATO for the conflict suggesting that Russia’s invasion was a result of NATO’s expansionism or aggressive intentions toward Russia. In this context, pro-Russian propaganda argues that the West has no moral high ground to condemn the invasion and nations such as Canada, the US, and the UK are trying to force Europe into this conflict to benefit materially. Second, it is suggested that Western nations are propping up fascists in Ukraine, thus justifying Russia’s actions. Thirdly, pro-Russian narrative attempts to amplify mistrust of democratic institutions, be it the media, international institutions, or the Liberal government. Faced with the challenges associated with foreign interference, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the spread of disinformation in Canada.</ab>

        <ab>Social media is fast becoming a key instrument to manipulate or influence social perception. Digital platforms are having a serious effect on the manipulation of public opinion through the spread of political propaganda and message amplification via coordinated campaigns. As one of the most used social platforms among politicians and democratic governments, Twitter plays a critical role in how information flows through trending topics. The main purpose of this study is to explore how coordinated campaigns, in this case astroturfing, were used to influence and manipulate public opinion during the coronavirus health crisis in Mexico. Our research provides new insights into the early detection of astroturfing and artificial amplification, in order to expose the efforts to manipulate online discourse in Mexico. In the pages that follow, it will be argued that Mexico is currently experiencing online manipulation through malicious strategies that may threaten its democracy. The following hashtags were used to explore and compare our approach in Mexico: #GatellOrgulloMexicano (Gatell Mexican Pride) and #AMLOPresidenteDeLaSalud (AMLO President of Health). This study intends to build awareness and to improve the public's understanding coordinated behavior on Twitter.</ab>

        <ab>This article focuses on the three Israeli digital campaigns during 2019–20 elections through their most prominent negative trends, namely: fake news, accounts and identities; politicians' chat bots; influence and interruption networks, illegal information accumulation on Israeli citizens via social media and voting apps; anonymous and fake spam, and a complete lack of compliance with the statutory and regulatory framework. With technology's speedy advancement, legal tools' lagging, and political actors' exploitation of the situation to their benefit, it seems that these campaigns, setting forth a fifth phase of political communication – Algorithmic Campaigns – constitute a rather bleak and grim future, as far as elections are concerned, thereby calling for rethinking.</ab>

        <ab>The announcement of the State of Alarm in Spain in March 2020 brought with it a period of great information intensity in traditional and digital media. The extraordinary nature of the measure, which provided the Government with exceptional measures to confront the Covid-19 pandemic, gave rise to a tremendously polarized scenario. In this context, some webs known for the dissemination of disinformation campaigns and, even, the promotion of ideas closes to the alt-right, were especially active in networks promoting the dissemination of ideological content with the aim of capturing traffic for subsequent monetization through advertising. This work follows the activity around of two of these webs on Twitter, Caso Aislado and Periodista Digital, with the intention of determinate their role in the political polarization. For more than two months, more than 100,000 tweets were captured, stored and studied using R software and various analysis algorithms to determine their social activity, the possible presence or not of bots or automated profiles, the nature of the content and the emotional charge associated with it. There is an intense organized activity around both portals through a high percentage of apparently automated accounts and the support of influencers profiles. Although with differences inherent around each web, it is possible to glimpse an intentional coordination through campaigns that combine content, use of support accounts and automations.</ab>

        <ab>Maligned actors use fake social media accounts and automated tools, also called computational propaganda, to launch disinformation operations. While technology companies and researchers continue to advance computational propaganda detection, they also know that eradicating social bots and disinformation is impossible. Since computational propaganda continues to increase, governments need to focus their efforts on developing policies that decrease citizen demand for disinformation. The purpose of this article is to explore disinformation at the intersection between technology and citizen resiliency. First, the current landscape will be explored to understand the impact of disinformation on society and its citizens. Second, the effect of technology on the supply of disinformation will be examined. Third, methods to decrease the demand for disinformation will be considered to increase citizen resiliency.</ab>

        <ab>Twitter is an Online Social Network (OSN). It is a significant forum for public expression and building relationships. By 2020, Twitter has reached nearly 353.1 million active users per month. However, a considerable number of online user accounts can be automated profiles. It is predicted that roughly 52 million profiles on Twitter are bots. Some bots perform positive operations like publishing news, scientific articles, and support emergencies. However, there also exist some bots that deceive genuine users by sharing spurious content or distributing malware. Henceforth, discovery of suspicious accounts is mandatory to ensure a safe Twitter environment. This paper has proposed novel approaches to identify bots by determining the randomness and regularity present in the temporal tweet attribute of the user. The real-time tweets posted by individual Twitter profiles are collected and the number of tweets posted by the user over a sampling period is extracted as an activity signal. Later, the degree of regularity present in the activity signals is measured through the lens of entropy. In this work, the probabilistic concepts, Approximate Entropy, and Sample Entropy are utilized to quantify the global degree of regularity in the signal. Accounts with entropy values less than the fixed threshold are labeled as bots. Thus, the nature of the Twitter profile (bot or human) can be determined. Our technique yields an F1 score of 0.8759 and 0.8349 for Approximate Entropy and Sample Entropy, respectively. Point-biserial correlation is employed to establish the association between the entropy values and the class of Twitter users.</ab>

        <ab>The cyber army in manipulating public opinion has become a hot foresight issue. The operating procedure and details of how cyber armies influence people's thoughts are not clarified. Our research model combines computational algorithms and statistical methods from comprehensive and microscope dimension to analyze embedding operation systems and their influence of a specific manipulating group recognized by Taiwan judicial departments. Research shows that this group's working type is well-trained with a sophisticated work division, and the cyber army's influence is demonstrated by the speed with which the cyber army's comments appear, rather than on a bias that the cyber army only manipulates other people's stances and support specific stance to influence people's thoughts. This study's findings will serve as the foundation for future research on social media manipulation, allowing future studies to be more efficient.</ab>

        <ab>Russia has been credibly accused of trying to weaken Western liberal democracies with use of digital means. Cybersecurity experts, intelligence agencies, investigative journalists, and government services, have detailed the Kremlin's actions in illegally accessing digital infrastructures, disseminating stolen contents online, and influencing political debate on digital platforms to create dissention and polarization. These initiatives are included in a wider strategy of altering the balance of power in the international order via what are known as ‘active measures’. Two of the most consequential recent application of this kind of measures took place in 2016, in the United States Presidential Elections and in the Brexit Referendum. Reports made public with the assessments of errors committed by the United States and the United Kingdom governments show there was an insufficient protection of those two crucial public consultation processes. The mistakes made by these countries in protecting democracy from hostile agents with a high level of digital proficiency, should be a point of interest, and urgency, for the European Union. It is to be expected that this kind of influence operation will continue, and become more sophisticated, as they can target elections in Member States of the Union, but also for the European Parliament. The early detection, applying of countermeasures, and the sharing of information with the voters of this kind of attacks by foreign agencies is an important defense mechanism that needs to be strengthen and expanded.</ab>

        <ab>The effectiveness of approaches to bot detection varies, with real-time detection being almost impossible. As a result, this article argues that the general Twitter using public cannot be expected to judge which accounts are bots with certainty and therefore do not know to what extent they are being manipulated online. In this article, the challenge of detecting bots and fake accounts is demonstrated by constructing two distinct methods to bot detection. The first method takes a fixed criteria-based approach, by building on commonly cited identifiers for bots. The second method takes a more flexible, investigative approach in order to uncover bots involved in coordinated efforts to influence online debates. As well as profiling the specific mechanics of how each one operates, we argue that they can be compared against an evaluative framework that specifies a set of key criteria that bot detection methods should meet in order to perform. Here, we identify four key criteria on which these methods can be evaluated and then examine how they perform in terms of the key criteria of accuracy. The results of these methods are then compared and cross-checked against an existing and widely used bot detection service. The findings show that different bot detection methods can present significantly different results and that only confirmation from Twitter, through suspensions or announcements, can truly allow users to know whether an account is a bot or not. We argue that this development could have a significant effect on the level of trust that social media users have both in the information they receive through social media and also in the political process.</ab>

        <ab>Computational technologies have vastly replaced our prior modalities of information seeking. Social media platforms have become the first choice of many information seekers. Increasingly, these platforms are also becoming vehicles for coordinated, manipulative disinformation campaigns. These campaigns of computational propaganda have resulted in an information environment in which the assignment of authority and trust in information sources has become increasingly opaque. This epistemic process of information evaluation has increasingly become the purview of automated algorithmic systems that we as human beings tend to falsely implicitly trust to provide us with the most accurate information available. Propagandists have begun to exploit the algorithmic components of these systems as well as human cognitive deficits in order to manipulate public opinion, control the narrative of public discourse, and flood our information ecosystems in order to work towards the manufacture of false consensus on a wide range of political and cultural issues. This work aims to review and synthesize the literature on computational propaganda, how it manipulates our human cognitive deficits, and how information literacy can be utilized in order to correct for the resultant epistemic failure.</ab>

        <ab>Threats of social media manipulation during elections have become a central concern for modern democracies. This study tackles the problem of identifying the purpose and origins of social bots during electoral campaigns. We propose a methodology – uniform manifold approximation and projection combined with user-level document embeddings – that efficiently reveals the community structure of social media users. We show that this method can be used to predict the partisan affiliation of social media users with high accuracy, detect anomalous concentrations of social bots, and infer their geographical origin. We illustrate the methodology using Twitter data from the 2019 Canadian electoral campaign. Our evidence supports the thesis that social bots have become an integral component of campaign strategy for national actors. We also demonstrate how the methodology can be deployed to identify clusters of foreign bots, and we show that such accounts were used to share far-right and environment-related content during the campaign.</ab>

It mentions campaign finance law, arguing for campaign disclosure laws requiring those who use online and social media to influence voters. It also mentions difficulty of using courts to adjudicate voting rights claims when there is fundamental disagreement about the basic facts related to issues.</ab>

        <ab>This work aims to establish whether astroturfing was used during the Covid-19 pandemic to manipulate Spanish public opinion through Twitter. This study analyzes tweets published in Spanish and geolocated in the Philippines, and its first objective is to determine the existence of an organized network that directs its messages mainly towards Spain. To determine the non-existence of a random network, a preliminary collection of 1,496,596 tweets was carried out. After determining its 14 main clusters, 280 users with a medium-low profile of participation and micro- and nano-influencer traits were randomly selected and followed for 103 days, for a total of 309,947 tweets. Network science, text mining, sentiment and emotion, and bot probability analyses were performed using Gephi and R. Their network structure suggests an ultra-small-world phenomenon, which would determine the existence of a possible organized network that tries not to be easily identifiable. The data analyzed confirm a digital communication scenario in which astroturfing is used as a strategy aimed at manipulating public opinion through non-influencers (cybertroops). These users create and disseminate content with proximity and closeness to different groups of public opinion, mixing topics of general interest with disinformation or polarized content.</ab>

        <ab>The fear of humans abusing technology to control others and the sociopolitical order has been at the heart of many dystopian stories. This fear is also at the heart of Watch_Dogs 2, where the centralized citywide management system made by the Blume Corporation, called ctOS, has become the basis for all things online. Over the course of the story, the player becomes part of the hacktivist group DedSec, who uncover and disclose the manipulative usage of the internet by Blume and other tech corporations. The oppressive system of surveillance, automated data collection, and (social) media manipulation is presented in detail during the main and side missions of the game. These missions criticize current topics of interest regarding internet and data security by referencing specific events and addressing important, underlying issues. The game also includes gameplay aspects where players are able to experience and perform the power of the system first-hand. However, textual analyses of the narrative and the ludic elements reveal contradictions and incoherencies between gameplay design and the narrative's intended criticism caused by the interplay of narrative storytelling and gameplay elements. The result is a split of atmosphere between story and gameplay, creating the impression that Watch_Dogs 2 has two contradicting personalities, which ultimately subvert its own dystopian criticism.</ab>

        <ab>Twitter is a renowned microblogging site that allows users to interact using tweets and it has almost reached 206 million daily active users by the second quarter of 2021. The ratio of Twitter bots has risen in tandem with their popularity. Bot detection is critical for combating misinformation and protecting the credibility of online disclosures. Current bot detection approaches rely on the Twitosphere's topological structure, ignoring the heterogeneity among the profiles. Moreover, most techniques incorporate supervised learning, which depends strongly on large-scale training sets. Therefore, to overcome these issues, we proposed a novel entropy-based framework to detect correlated bots leveraging only user behavior. Specifically, real-time data of users is collected and their online behaviors are modeled as DNA sequences. We then determine the probability distribution of DNA sequences and compute relative entropy to evaluate the distance between the distributions. Accounts with entropy values less than a fixed threshold represent bots. Extensive experiments conducted in real-time Twitter data prove that the proposed detection technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with precision = 0.9471, recall = 0.9682, F1 score = 0.9511, and accuracy = 0.9457.</ab>

        <ab>The promotion of healthy nutrition and diet advice is a key tenet of public health strategies to combat obesity worldwide. Increasingly, social media is a major source of health information however is not subject to the same filtering and quality control as required by public health bodies or commercial sources. Consequently, unqualified users, poor quality nutrition and diet information, and social bots are an increasing feature of the nutrition and diet discourse on social media. Such activity may result in adverse impacts to the public and interfere with official public health education and promotion campaigns. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to detect (i) unqualified Twitter accounts, and (ii) tweets featuring low quality nutritional advice. We test the proposed model on dataset comprised of tweet data and profiles associated with over 1.2m tweets on nutrition and diet over a 16-month period from January 2018 to April 2019. Preliminary results suggest that the LSTM performs significantly better for profiles than tweets, averaging between 87% and 94% for accuracy, sensitivity, precision and F1-Score, and achieving 47% for specificity. These values are much lower for the tweets classifier.</ab>

        <ab>This paper aims to investigate Croatian consumers' attitudes about mobile messenger chatbots (MMC) and their propensity to use them. The proposed conceptual model is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). The research was conducted through an anonymous survey questionnaire available on the social network Facebook. The empirical research results show that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, and attitude towards mobile advertisements are statistically significantly related to attitude towards mobile messenger chatbots. No negative correlation was found between internet privacy concern and consumer attitudes about mobile messenger chatbots. A positive correlation was found between attitude towards using mobile messenger chatbots and behavioral intention. In addition to the scientific contribution in better predicting chatbots' acceptance as a communication and promotional tool, the research results will also help marketing experts design advertising campaigns via mobile messenger chatbots.</ab>

        <ab>What makes humour an honest and a direct communication tool for people? How do social networking and digital media transmit user-generated political and humorous content? Our research argues that the way in which humour is deployed through digital media during protest action allows protestors to assert humanity and sincerity against dehumanising political manipulation frameworks. Humorous content, to this extent, enables and is indicative of independent thinking and creativity. It causes contemplation, confronts the hegemonic power of the oppressor, and challenges fear and apathy. In order to conduct this research, we collected and analysed tweets shared during the Gezi Park protests. Gezi Parkı was chosen as the keyword since it was an unstructured and neutral term. Among millions of visual images shared during the protests, we concentrate on those that depict humour both in photography and video formats.</ab>

        <ab>The public relations activity is defined as an area of strategic communication which acts on building mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their audiences. Constant social transformations have an impact on the social perception of different themes, which in turn also directly affects the positioning of organizations. In this scenario, we discuss the term "astroturfing" and its similarities and/or differences concerning public relations based on a relational perspective of communication. This article is characterized as an exploratory research based on a bibliographic analysis. The object of study is astroturfing in the context of public relations; therefore, a qualitative approach has been used. We observed that the extreme usage of digital social networks has contributed to numerous scenarios of misinformation which, therefore, end up encouraging deceptive or simulated practices arising from different social institutions. Thus, it is in such a context that the practice of astroturfing can be seen. This practice emerged in the 1980s in the United States during an election campaign in which there were disputes for a favourable public opinion. The term is an analogy to the word "grassroots, that is, how spontaneous popular manifestations are known in the US, and AstroTurf is a brand of artificial grass created by Monsanto in the 1960s, which is famous for its similarity to the appearance of real grass" (Silva, 2013: 14). The phenomenon can be seen as the creation of public manifestations by an audience that does not exist in order to achieve a favourable scenario for organizational objectives. In a practical way, communication processes can act as astroturfing drivers, thus contributing to the emergence of artificial contexts. In this article, we investigate the communication process by reflecting on the importance of the PR professional who looks at the public from a relational perspective. The connection of such a phenomenon with the field of public relations derives from the practices of international agencies that have subtly used astroturfing to achieve the goals of their clients in such a way that organizational ethics committees do not clearly perceive it. This is one of the aspects that leads professionals in the area to question what would or would not be ethical. Public relations, as an expression of strategic communication, has the ability to observe scenarios, mobilize forces and elaborate narratives that enable the construction of an organizational image and reputation. Perhaps an adequate translation of these strategic efforts is to recognize the connections among public relations, its audiences and the public opinion. In this scenario, there are ample information flows from the mediatized context that sometimes can create gaps for the practice of astroturfing. We understand that the phenomenon is consolidated as a contemporary challenge in the market, mainly in communication. Therefore, we highlight on how the ethical dimensions of public relations permeate the purpose of balance and harmony of interests. It is urgent to act, not only for the aesthetics but also for the ethics of the profession, in favour of the strengthening of the subjects and, consequently, the quality of the established social relations.</ab>

        <ab>Scientific methods are used to monitor fish growth and behavior and reduce the loss caused by stress and other circumstances. Conventional techniques are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to accidents. Deep learning (DL) technology is rapidly gaining popularity in various fields, including aquaculture. Moving towards smart fish farming necessitates the precise and accurate identification of fish biodiversity. Observing fish behavior in real time is imperative to make better feeding decisions. The proposed study consists of an efficient end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) classifying fish behavior into the normal and starvation categories. The performance of the CNN is evaluated by varying the number of fully connected (FC) layers with or without applying max-pooling operation. The accuracy of the detection algorithm is increased by 10% by incorporating three FC layers and max pooling operation. The results demonstrated that the shallow architecture of the CNN model, which employs a max-pooling function with more FC layers, exhibits promising performance and achieves 98% accuracy. The presented system is a novel step in laying the foundation for an automated behavior identification system in modern fish farming.</ab>

        <ab>It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using ‘social bots’ deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques.</ab>

        <ab>Using Christopher Walker's and Jessica Ludwig's 'sharp power' theoretical framework, and based on some preliminary findings from the May 2019 European Parliament election and the two 2019 rounds of elections in Israel, this article describes a novel method for the automatic detection of political trolls and bots active in Twitter in the October 2019 federal election in Canada. The research identified thousands of accounts invested in Canadian politics that presented a unique activity pattern, significantly different from accounts in a control group. The large-scale cross-cross-sectional approach enabled a distinctive perspective on foreign political meddling in Twitter during the recent federal election campaign. This foreign political meddling, we argue, aims at manipulating and poisoning the democratic process and can challenge democracies and their values, as well as their societal resilience.</ab>

        <ab>This study develops upon recent scholarship about the Russian government's digital influence campaign to cultivate Black Americans during the 2016 election by rooting their efforts within a century-long strategy to exploit racial inequality to discredit and damage American democracy. Guided by Shifman's (2013) construct of memetics, we employed a novel methodology that combined journalistic fact-checking and critical, qualitative analysis to study 164 Facebook advertisements targeted at Black Americans. These advertisements closely resembled Soviet-era propaganda and new disinformation strategies facilitated by the affordances of Facebook. Our findings reveal the advertisements exploited Facebook's interactive design and used an insider's voice to share real news about racial inequality, celebrate Black culture, and coordinate civic action. This study's methodological approach provides a meaningful framework for understanding how actors hack and deploy cultural knowledge to spread disinformation through social media platforms.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this paper is to analyze the argumentative structure of fake news in the Covid-19-era by focusing on its argumentative strength and persuasiveness. The concepts of Rhetoric of Reaction (HIRSCHMAN, 1992), Ethos and Pathos of Aristotle's Classical Rhetoric and Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's New Rhetoric (1996) were the framework for the analysis. Our methodology was based on the analysis of three fake news reports related to the negationist campaign against the Covid-19 pandemic, each of which was taken as a prototype of the following categories proposed by Hirschman (1992): perversity, futility, and jeopardy theses. The results indicate that fake news should be understood as an inherently digital phenomenon that uses well-developed argumentative strategies as its objective is to cause discredit and doubt in the public opinion. Therefore, if we take the average citizen into account, fake news is highly persuasive and consequently should be considered of extreme danger to society and its democratic and scientific principles.</ab>

        <ab>Over the past two decades, the business model of surveillance capitalism has emerged in the IT industry. This model has turned out to be highly profitable, but, if left unchecked, will very likely undermine the foundations of liberal democracies and quality of life on this planet. It involves customized advertising and behavior manipulation, powered by intensive gathering and cross-correlation of personal information. There are significant indirect costs of this model, including loss of privacy, supporting surveillance by both the state and corporations, undermining the democratic process, other kinds of automated attempts of behavior manipulation, and excessive consumerism with its attendant environmental costs. Turning to what could be done, we propose a co-development of regulation and technology, as well as the key roles that can be played by citizens and civil society organizations. The regulatory measures are intended to safeguard privacy, require true informed consent, and to foster interoperability (even among rival firms, nonprofit organizations, and others). We also identify key enabling technologies, including open source, APIs to support interoperability and portability, encryption, and peer-to-peer systems. Finally, we discuss the crucial role of ownership structures for these IT services and argue for an ecosystem approach as a counter narrative to surveillance capitalism.</ab>

        <ab>The self-proclaimed front page of the internet, Reddit is a many faceted site, described variously as an assemblage of online communities, a social news aggregation website and a social media site. Reddit is one of the most popular sites online both in terms of visitation and interaction. Central to Reddit's popularity is its active community of users who contribute posts, comments and votes to subreddits resulting in a series of constantly changing bulletin boards comprised of over 3 billion submissions annually. Since its inception in 2005, Reddit has generated polarized engagement and responses to this community activity from wildly positive to highly toxic. Recent developments around perceived political manipulation of and on Reddit and accusations of content manipulation and censorship have raised questions of trust in the Reddit platform. Since 2019 Reddit has sought to identify and mitigate bad actor behaviour, address content manipulation and maintain the site's authenticity and the historical context of Reddit's attempts to address each is of central concern to this article. How this history then intersects with contemporary ideas of digital resignation and commons-based models of management informs analysis in the article on moderation practices, opens up new possibilities for future research into concepts of platform literacy and structural (digital) imagination.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this paper is to critically reflect on why scholars need to reevaluate the definition of intelligence practices in the 21st century. Our assessment starts with digital communication advancements and their progressive appropriation by power agents to the benefit of propaganda, disinformation, and political manipulation. While analyzing the very nature of intelligence as being 'institutionally' and 'nationally' constructed, the paper advances a new, deeply societal model in which intelligence is de-reified and approached as key instrument in diverting the use of digital communication to de-construct polarizing narratives.</ab>

        <ab>Online astroturfing is a novel form of disinformation that relies on the imitation of citizen voices to create the false impression that a particular view or idea has widespread support in society. In this study, we test if political online astroturfing messages (i.e., forged user comments beneath digital news items) can influence perceptions of public opinion on three issues: the poisoning of the former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, the use of toxic gas by Russia's close ally Syria, and the manipulation of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We further examine the immunizing effects of three inoculation strategies to prevent the distorting effects of online astroturfing comments. Our results indicate that only a few astroturfing comments can bias readers' perceptions of public opinion in the intended direction. Moreover, prior inoculation only provides limited protection against this effect. Only one inoculation strategy (refutational‐same) proved to be effective, but even this effect is only short‐term. Our findings indicate that recent fears about the potentially negative effects of this novel form of disinformation on political discourse are justified and underscore the difficulties of responding to this challenge.</ab>

        <ab>From contaminated water pipes to social media manipulation to sinking cities, infrastructures increasingly appear at the heart of cultural, political, and environmental crises. As a technique of governance, infrastructures delegate control to systems and disperse power into the environment. This special issue argues that engaging with infrastructural politics requires new tactics and modes of analysis which take seriously the politics of articulation, everyday life, and meaning. The introductory essay situates the project of infrastructural politics within the critical and cross-disciplinary literature on infrastructure and the political tradition of Cultural Studies. We identify distinctive features of infrastructural politics, organized around the concepts of scale, formalization, and imaginary, that set forth the common concerns of the issue and raise questions for future research. Following this discussion, we introduce the essays of the issue, spanning topics that include emergency dispatch, automated music mastering, open pit coal mines, homeless encampments, police body cameras, and sand. Throughout, the issue is animated by a commitment shared among founding figures of Cultural Studies, activists, and abolitionists: the capacity to critically engage infrastructure in order to improve the lived conditions of culture.</ab>

        <ab>Online talk about racism has been salient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet while such social media conversations reflect existing tensions in the offline world, the same discourse has also become a target for information operations aiming to heighten social divisions. This article examines Twitter discussions of racism in the first and sixth months since COVID-19 was accorded pandemic status by the World Health Organization and uncovers dynamic associations with bot activity and hate speech. Humans initially constituted the most hateful accounts in online conversations about racism in March, but in August, bots dominated hate speech. Over time, greater bot activity likewise amplified levels of hate speech a week later. Moreover, while discourse about racism in March primarily featured an organic focus on racial identities like Asian and Chinese, we further observed a bot-dominated focus in August toward political identities like president, Democrat, and Republican. Although hate speech targeting Asian groups remained present among racism discussions in August, these findings suggest a bot-fueled redirection from focusing on racial groups at the onset of the pandemic to targeting politics closer to the 2020 US elections. This work enhances understanding of the complexity of racism discussions during the pandemic, its vulnerability to manipulation through information operations, and the large-scale quantitative study of inorganic hate campaigns in online social networks.</ab>

        <ab>This editorial will describe how social media platforms, facial recognition software, and the monetization of data have rendered privacy obsolete, and then present technologically possible and politically viable responses to this threat. Microsoft has proposed federal regulation of FR software (https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-calls-for-federal-regulation-of-facial-recognition/), while Apple has argued for a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearinghouse where all data brokers must register (https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502591/tim-cook-data-privacy/). Data harvesting and social media manipulation plague democracies because citizens demand privacy, yet consumers willingly cooperate with or acquiesce to private-sector revenue- and profit-maximization strategies.</ab>

        <ab>The media ecosystem is constantly changing, transforming at a rhythm that educational institutions cannot keep up with. In this media transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced, adapted to social networks for various purposes, including political ones. This work focuses on AI in bot format as an automated tool to publish content on Twitter and on the skills needed to identify them. Bots seek to imitate human behaviour to create a climate of concrete opinion, participate in political conversations and interact with real accounts in order to boycott them or increase their relevance. In order to know the level of media literacy of journalism students and increase their skills to identify this type of manipulation of the public sphere, a teaching intervention is designed at university level, applied to a sample of 55 students, consisting of a workshop to identify bots on Twitter. From the results of the workshop, evaluated through questionnaires, it is observed that the students have previous skills acquired informally to detect bots and that after the workshop the ability to identify these accounts slightly increases and, above all, they manifest a more conscious process when they face them. This paper presents the design of the workshop and its evaluation.</ab>

To study the context in which electoral disinformation operates, a bot was created on Twitter (@unfaking_es) that followed the activity of the accounts of the main media, political parties, candidates, official institutions and factcheckers. Most of the 37 hoaxes analysed originated on social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, and the electoral system itself was the main target of disinformation, being labelled as fraudulent. The debate on Twitter was dominated by live fact-checking carried out carried out by left-wing media, media, with Pablo Casado (Popular with Pablo Casado (Popular Party) being the most frequently debunked candidate. most frequently debunked candidate.</ab>

        <ab>Political astroturfing, a centrally coordinated disinformation campaign in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens acting independently, has the potential to influence electoral outcomes and other forms of political behavior. Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without "ground truth" information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National Information Service's (NIS) disinformation campaign during the presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of participating accounts published in court proceedings. Features that best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory.</ab>

        <ab>PURPOSE: We developed a Web-based chatbot (ItRunsInMyFamily.com) to help individuals collect their family health history (FHx) and determine their risk for hereditary cancer. The purpose of the current study was to assess the characteristics of users and identify opportunities to improve the FHx collection tool. METHODS: During Family Health History Month (November 2019) we launched an FHx campaign using social media advertisements to raise awareness about hereditary cancers and encourage individuals in the general population to use ItRunsInMyFamily to collect their FHx. Through this campaign, we were able to gather information about users and identify opportunities to improve the tool. RESULTS: We reached 14,140 users in November 2019 through online marketing campaigns—Facebook, Google, previous ItRuns users, and Web site marketing. Of those, 3,204 completed the full FHx assessment and received risk recommendations. The campaign targeted women between age 40 and 60 years. Users came from 3,783 counties around the United States, 48 unique cancers were reported among probands, and 79 unique cancers were reported among family members, an average of two and a half cancers per family. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that it is possible to gather FHx information at the population level, with high levels of engagement and interest in the topic. There is room for future enhancements and improvements to ItRunsInMyFamily to broaden its reach and encourage individuals to learn about and record their health information.</ab>

        <ab>This exploratory study examines the strategies of social bots on Twitter that were retweeted following a mass shooting event. Using a case study method to frame our work, we collected over seven million tweets during a one‐month period following a mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. From this dataset, we selected retweets of content generated by over 400 social bot accounts to determine what strategies these bots were using and the effectiveness of these strategies as indicated by the number of retweets. We employed qualitative and quantitative methods to capture both macro‐ and micro‐level perspectives. Our findings suggest that bots engage in more diverse strategies than solely waging disinformation campaigns, including baiting and sharing information. Further, we found that while bots amplify conversation about mass shootings, humans were primarily responsible for disseminating bot‐generated content. These findings add depth to the current understanding of bot strategies and their effectiveness. Understanding these strategies can inform efforts to combat dubious information as well as more insidious disinformation campaigns.</ab>

        <ab>This article uses social media network analysis (SMNA) to examine whether there was an astroturfing campaign on Twitter in support of the Adani Carmichael coal mine in 2017. It shows that SMNA can be used to visualize and analyze outsider lobbying activity in issue arenas and is capable of identifying networks of fake opinion. This study found that in April 2017, there was a small network of accounts that made a series of suspiciously similar pro‐Adani tweets that could be considered a form of duplicitous lobbying. However, this study concludes that these posts were likely a weak influence on public opinion in Australia and largely ineffectual as a lobbying tactic. Nevertheless, this analysis shows how communitas public interests can be subverted by covert social media campaigns used in support of corporatas goals, as well as the role digital research methods can play in protecting the integrity on public debates by exposing disingenuous actors.</ab>

        <ab>Information manipulation is widespread in today's media environment. Online networks have disrupted the gatekeeping role of traditional media by allowing various actors to influence the public agenda; they have also allowed automated accounts (or bots) to blend with human activity in the flow of information. Here, we assess the impact that bots had on the dissemination of content during two contentious political events that evolved in real time on social media. We focus on events of heightened political tension because they are particularly susceptible to information campaigns designed to mislead or exacerbate conflict. We compare the visibility of bots with human accounts, verified accounts, and mainstream news outlets. Our analyses combine millions of posts from a popular microblogging platform with web-tracking data collected from two different countries and timeframes. We employ tools from network science, natural language processing, and machine learning to analyze the diffusion structure, the content of the messages diffused, and the actors behind those messages as the political events unfolded. We show that verified accounts are significantly more visible than unverified bots in the coverage of the events but also that bots attract more attention than human accounts. Our findings highlight that social media and the web are very different news ecosystems in terms of prevalent news sources and that both humans and bots contribute to generate discrepancy in news visibility with their activity.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, I try to show that some radical right and left-wing political discourses manipulate the language about the coronavirus, in order to sustain their biased and baseless claims about the Covid-19 pandemic. This kind of manipulation fits the view that political manipulation of language is based on a fusion of partial truths and whole lies (Katukani, 2018). The data was collected from the Brazilian far-right news website criticanacional.com.br and from the book The sovereign virus?, written by the postmodern leftist philosopher Donatella di Cesare. Data analysis shows that the most noteworthy manipulation found in these political discourses is the concealment of relevant information about where the virus is. The large majority of sentences about the virus found in the corpus offers no hint where the virus is located or how it is spreading. It will be shown that this concealment favors the baseless claims of both radical political discourses. In order to make a comparison with the results from those studies, I collected data from the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo. The finding is that the sentences from this newspaper are much more precise about where the virus is.</ab>

        <ab>The production and distribution of news is changing. At the same time, the relationship between journalism and artificial intelligence systems is becoming stronger. Within this context, conversational bots have appeared, which are software applications that distribute personalised content (Al Johri et al., 2016) through social networks, online instant messaging apps, and mobile devices. This research presents a case study on the conversational political news bot known as Politibot, which is a pioneering, successful Spanish project that emerged during the 2016 election campaign. The study analyses users' perceptions of the bot as a news and conversational tool based on their experience of use. An experimental methodology has been used in combination with other qualitative and quantitative research techniques (documentary analysis, direct observation, registration forms, as well as pre-test and post-test by means of questionnaires). The results show widespread acceptance in terms of reliability, comprehension, and the format regarding the information received from the bot, as well as its immediacy and customisation. However, the possibility of interacting with bots is still limited, which is also true of the case under study herein.</ab>

        <ab>The increasingly complex relationship between conventional media, digital platforms, political actors and audiences merits an exhaustive analysis of the functions and relationships between them and the perceptions about media and media manipulation from youth audiences. This research addresses the manipulation of Bolivian television news content by commercial and political interests. The analysis has a Latin American theoretical-critical foundation, in which the qualitative technique of Group Discussion (GD) was applied to four groups of high school students in the main cities of Bolivia: El Alto-La Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and Oruro. The originality of this work is based on considering the opinions of young people, primary consumers of audiovisual media, giving prominence to their concerns and ideas. As the main findings, it was evidenced that young students highlight the excessive political manipulation of information from public and community media, recognizing the need to develop media competencies to face the alleged social control. On the other hand, they propose citizen interpellation through the use of Information Technologies to democratize communication.</ab>

        <ab>Social bots mimic and potentially manipulate humans and their behaviours in social networks. The public sphere might be especially vulnerable to their impacts, which is why we first discuss their potential influence on the public sphere from a theoretical perspective. From an empirical perspective, we analyzed Twitter followers of seven German parties before (N = 638,674) and during (N = 838,026) the 2017 electoral campaigns regarding bot prevalence and activities. The results revealed that the share of social bots increased from 7.1% before to 9.9% during the election campaigns. The percentage of active social bots remained roughly the same. An analysis of the content distributed by both the most popular and the most active bots showed that they disseminate few political hashtags, and that almost none referred to German politics. We discuss the results against the background of normative traditions of public sphere theories and address the methodological challenges bots pose in political communication.</ab>

        <ab>Human behaviors, with whole-body coordination, involve large-scale sensorimotor interaction. Spontaneous bodily movements in the early developmental stage potentially lead toward acquisition of such coordinated behavior. These movements presumably contribute to the structuration of sensorimotor interaction, providing specific regularities in bidirectional information among muscle activities and proprioception. Whether and how spontaneous movements, despite being task-free, structure and organize sensorimotor interactions in the entire body during early development remain unknown. Herein, to address these issues, we gained insights into the structuration process of the sensorimotor interaction in neonates and 3-mo-old infants. By combining detailed motion capture and musculoskeletal simulation, sensorimotor information flows among muscle activities and proprioception throughout the body were obtained. Subsequently, we extracted spatial modules and temporal state in sensorimotor information flows. Our approach demonstrated that early spontaneous movements elicited body-dependent sensorimotor modules, revealing age-related changes in them, depending on the combination or direction. The sensorimotor interactions also displayed temporal non-random fluctuations analogous to those seen in spontaneous activities in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. Furthermore, we found recurring state sequence patterns across multiple participants, characterized by a substantial increase in infants compared to the patterns in neonates. Therefore, early spontaneous movements induce the spatiotemporal structuration in sensorimotor interactions and subsequent developmental changes. These results implicated that early open-ended movements, emerging from a certain neural substrate, regulate the sensorimotor interactions through embodiment and contribute to subsequent coordinated behaviors. Our findings also provide a conceptual linkage between early spontaneous movements and spontaneous neuronal activity in terms of spatiotemporal characteristics.</ab>

        <ab>This paper argues that one of the major purposes of a disinformation campaign is to sustain a discursive conflict between users of social networks. By examining the phenomenon of "unfriending," the paper describes how disinformation campaigns sabotage horizontal connections between individuals on either side of a conflict and strengthen a state's capacity to construct an image of an external enemy. The paper argues that horizontal connections are targeted because they have the potential to mitigate social cleavages, challenging state control over the legitimacy of a conflict narrative. Understanding disinformation campaigns as a technology for the facilitation of social polarization and the destruction of strong social ties allows us to rethink policies for addressing the role of fake news, especially in the context of a conflict. The paper highlights the need to develop tools that defend users from engagement in manipulative discursive conflict and protect cross-conflict social capital as a resource for potential conflict resolution.</ab>

        <ab>In this article we analyse features of the information influence operations run by the St. Petersburg based Internet Research Agency, targeted at Europe. Informed by publicly available 'open source' data, the analysis delineates three key tactics that underpinned their disinformation campaign: account buying; 'follower fishing'; and narrative switching. Both individually and collectively these were designed to build the reach, impact and influence of the ideologically loaded messages that social media account operators authored and amplified. The particular value of the analysis is that whilst a lot of recent public and political attention has focussed upon Kremlin backed disinformation in respect of the 2016 United States presidential election, far less work has addressed their European activities.</ab>

        <ab>To nuance current understandings of the proliferation of digital disinformation, this article seeks to develop an approach that emphasizes the imaginative dimension of this communication phenomenon. Anchored on ideas about the sociality of communication, this piece conceptualizes how fake news and political trolling online work in relation to particular shared understandings people have of their socio-political landscape. It offers the possibility of expanding the information-oriented approach to communication taken by many journalistic interventions against digital disinformation. It particularly opens up alternatives to the problematic strategy of challenging social media manipulation solely by doubling down on objectivity and facts.</ab>

        <ab>Based on ethnographic research on Islamist buzzers -- social media political operators tasked with making particular online conversation subjects trend -- in Indonesia, this article details the process of how the proliferation of insensitive message in both the online and offline realms plays a role in mobilizing those sympathetic to religious fundamentalism. As this research shows, the interviewed buzzers were one of the driving forces behind the massive success of the fundamentalist Islamic Defenders Front (Front Pembela Islam, FPI) as they mobilized people to participate in the organization's political rallies between 2016 and 2017. Driven by altruistic volunteerism and sense of community, these actors go beyond their duty as click-farmers. They maintain regular contact with sympathizers and convincing them to revive broken weblinks, hang banners on streets as part of astroturfing campaigns and gather masses to attend offline events. Detailing the activity and spatiality of buzzers in crafting new online and offline spaces as part of their innovative bottom-up propaganda management, this research concludes that right-wing political mobilization and radicalization are not simply the product of ideology but are catalyzed by technically and socially tedious, mediated messaging campaigns.</ab>

        <ab>What have we learned about the use of robots in social networks and their communication effects? Considering the contemporary media practices, critical algorithmic studies have been debating a transformation in the regimes of visibility (Magalhães, 2018). This article takes up a case study of the 2014 presidential elections on the use of bots on Twitter as agentes of expression. When collecting digital data from Twitter, we process with a qualitative-quantitative technique of analyzing social networks to map computational propaganda strategies. Thus, under the effect of bots, the modulations produced from the interaction between human and non-human actors provide new parameters for understanding political-communicational phenomena.</ab>

        <ab>Botnets are the preeminent source of online crime and arguably one of the greatest threats to the Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we present ZombieCoin, a botnet command-and-control (C&amp;C) mechanism that leverages the Bitcoin network. ZombieCoin offers considerable advantages over existing C&amp;C techniques, most notably the fact that Bitcoin is designed to resist the very same takedown campaigns and regulatory processes that are the most often-used methods to combat botnets today. Furthermore, we describe how the Bitcoin network enables novel C&amp;C techniques, which dramatically expand the scope of this threat, including the possibilities of flexible rendezvous scheduling, efficient botnet partitioning, and fine-grained control over bots. We validate our claims by implementing ZombieCoin bots which we then deploy and successfully control over the Bitcoin network. Our findings lead us to believe that Bitcoin-based C&amp;C mechanisms are a highly desirable option that botmasters will pursue in the near future. We hope our study provides a useful first step towards devising effective countermeasures for this threat.</ab>

        <ab>Though nation-states have long utilized disinformation to influence foreign audiences, Russia's 2015 to 2017 campaign against the U.S.—executed by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) —is unique in its complexity and distribution through the digital communication ecology. The following study explores IRA activity on three social media platforms, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, to understand how activities on these sites were temporally coordinated. Using a VAR analysis with Granger Causality tests, results show that IRA Reddit activity granger caused IRA Twitter activity within a one-week lag. One explanation may be that the Internet Research Agency is trial ballooning on one platform (i.e., Reddit) to figure out which messages are optimal to distribute on other social media (i.e., Twitter).</ab>

        <ab>• We conducted a multi-method study: Online, driving simulator, vehicle-in-the-loop. • We analyzed passengers' risk perception and preferences for automated driving behavior. • Passengers prefer an early braking response when approaching a junction. • The results were very similar for driving simulator and vehicle-in-the-loop, indicating a high validity of the driving simulator. • The configuration of automated behavior should be adapted so that passengers experience no feeling of risk. The success of highly automated vehicles (HAVs; SAE Level 4) will depend to a large extent on how well they are accepted by their future passengers. This is especially true for the interaction of these vehicles with other human road users in mixed traffic. In future urban traffic, passengers of HAVs will observe from a passive position how the automated system resolves space-sharing conflicts with crossing vulnerable road users (VRUs; e.g., pedestrians and cyclists) at junctions. For one such crossing-paths conflict, we investigated when passengers would want the HAV to start braking and how much perceived risk passengers accept in the interaction of their vehicle with VRUs. To this end, we conducted 1) an online video study (N = 118), 2) a driving simulator study (N = 28), and 3) a human&amp;vehicle-in-the-loop (Hu&amp;ViL) study at a test site (N = 10). We varied the speed of the HAV (30 km/h vs. 50 km/h), the type (cyclist vs. pedestrian), and crossing direction of the VRU (left vs. right). During the approach to the junction, passengers' task was to trigger the HAV's braking maneuver, in a first trial at the point they considered ideal and in a second trial at the last point they still considered safe enough to decelerate and come to a stop at the stop line. For each braking maneuver, we analyzed the HAV's distance and time-to-arrival (TTA) to the VRU at braking onset, as well as passengers' perceived risk in the VRU interaction. The results showed that most passengers preferred harmless interactions with VRUs (at the ideal braking onset time), and accepted unpleasant, but not dangerous interactions at most (at the last acceptable braking onset time). Methodologically, the results were very similar in the three different environments (online, driving simulator, real vehicle). These results clearly show that, in addition to the technical considerations of safe automated driving, passengers' perception and evaluation of HAV driving behavior should also be taken into account to achieve a satisfying level of acceptance of these vehicles.</ab>

        <ab>As a part of education fostering diversity, human rights and gender equality, sex education has proved an ideal target for disinformation. This article offers an analysis of articles on sex education published between 2007 and 2016 on pro-Russian websites in Czech and Slovak. The extreme and manipulated representations of sex education on these websites are part of a Russian disinformation campaign that activates social anxiety by triggering emotions and utilising regionally sensitive issues to foment feelings of inferiority in post-socialist countries. The Russian Federation strives to be perceived as a saviour of traditional values, actively feeding a conservative backlash and anti-gender and anti-LGBT movements. It therefore recruits conservative allies across Europe to expand its sphere of influence.</ab>

        <ab>This article studies the dissemination of the disinformation campaign "Laranjal do Boulos" published during the debate of Folha de S.Paulo and UOL on the first round of the São Paulo mayor election. The theoretical framework integrates the academic research on disinformation, coordination tactics, and astroturfing. The data were collected from Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, capturing public mentions from a list of terms surrounding the case. The methodological procedures build on digital methods cross-platform analysis techniques and combine descriptive statistics and social network analysis. The results suggest coordination between Russomano's campaign and Oswaldo Eustaquio to create a live momentum of false accusations against Guilherme Boulos. In addition, the findings describe the temporal patterns of circulation and the spread of transmedia content. The remainder of the paper debates the challenges of moderating disinformation in social media and suggests future avenues for cross-platform studies.</ab>

        <ab>Zooming in on automated and semiautomated social actors created to influence public opinion on social media, we employ a novel analytic approach to identify patterns of inauthentic behavior across election campaigns on Twitter. Comparing two recent national election campaigns, the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the 2017 German federal election, we analyze patterns and effects of orchestrated intervention in political discourse on Twitter. Focusing on two main aspects of information flows—scale and range—we find that orchestrated interventions help amplify, but not diffuse, the candidates’ messages, mostly failing to reach new audiences in the process. This study adds an information diffusion perspective to a growing body of literature on computational propaganda, showing that although false amplification is quite effective in increasing the scale of information events, in most cases the information fails to reach new depths.</ab>

        <ab>Based on the materials of the conducted sociological research and analysis of the situation, the article examines the problems of youth media consumption and its influence on the formation of stereotypes of behavior from different angles. On the one hand, media consumption is considered as a factor influencing the successful socialization of the younger generation and the most effective in-depth career guidance, on the other hand, as a negative factor affecting the quality of processing and analysis of the information received in an avalanche, which undoubtedly negatively affects both the psychological and physical health of young people and the increasing vulnerability of young people to illegal and political manipulation. At the same time, the reverse side of media consumption, for example, computer games, is also the involvement of young people in gambling virtual games, as well as the formation of gambling addiction. The authors of the article come to the conclusion that uncontrolled pastime on the net, neglect of the protection of personal information, associated with the virtual absence of the formation of a national policy of information security culture of the individual, associated with a clear lack of training and skills development in the education system, as well as in the family and in society in the region. media education, especially in the context of information wars, will lead both to a number of destructive consequences in the field of youth and information policy in general, and to the degradation of the individual in particular. The materials obtained during the study and preparation of the article can be used by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation and the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs in order to determine areas of activity in the field of youth policy to prevent cyber threats, as well as to develop measures on working with youth in terms of informing them about working in an information-safe environment.</ab>

        <ab>Ever since David Cameron announced the UK's EU referendum in February 2016, discussions about Fake News during the Brexit campaign have been thriving and sparking debates on the role of social media in the run-up to Brexit. So far, research on this topic has mainly focused on the automatic spread of false information, through bots, for example. Building on the assumption that political leaders accounted for Fake News as well, my analysis adds a human component: I screened more than 1400 tweets posted by David Cameron, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage during the Brexit campaign. Using fact-checking platforms, I verified each leader's top three arguments for Remain or Leave. As the results show, some political leaders turned out to be part of the Fake News epidemic surrounding Brexit: Johnson and Farage shared multiple arguments that were clearly misleading, while Corbyn and Cameron mostly stuck to the facts (although some of their points were speculative). Furthermore, my analysis provides insights into the prevalent arguments used by the respective leaders and their performance on Twitter in general.</ab>

        <ab>Conventional as well as atypical threats and vulnerabilities tend to undermine the core principles and functioning mechanisms of democratic societies. This article examines internal weaknesses and foreign intervention operations seeking the manipulation of the electorate and thus diminishing legitimate political participation and questioning the very essence of democracy. The analytical focus is on manipulation and disinformation mainly through mass media and social network platforms. This is increasing the risk of undermining public confidence and trust in democratic institutions and processes. The main argument is that democratic institutions and processes can and must be made more resilient. The article provides a framework of analysis for the resilience of political institutions and processes and investigates current initiatives, including of EU and NATO, to strengthen resilience.</ab>

        <ab>I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist online harassment de-mobilizes the minorities it targets, and the open, unopposed expression of racism in a public forum can legitimize racist viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter. I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts I control ('bots') to sanction the harassers. By varying the identity of the bots between in-group (white man) and out-group (black man) and by varying the number of Twitter followers each bot has, I find that subjects who were sanctioned by a high-follower white male significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This paper extends findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data collection period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior.</ab>

        <ab>Russian disinformation activities imitate divisive U.S. political discourse within a polarized social media ecosystem. As part of a multipronged response, U.S. citizens have been urged to increase their personal vigilance and to identify inauthentic messages, hence flagging foreign-made disinformation by studying its content. However, by applying Taylor's concept of "imitation (in)security" to a set of Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA) Facebook and Instagram advertisements, this article explains why content-centered approaches to combatting disinformation need to be reimagined. Building upon imitation (in)security, we propose that the strength of the IRA disinformation campaign was not its ability to foist falsehoods upon unsuspecting Americans, but, rather, its uncanny imitation of prevalent themes, images, and arguments within American civic life. Our analysis of IRA-generated advertisements targeting U.S. military veterans demonstrates how IRA "trolls" were imitating American communication patterns to amplify existing positions within a deluge of messages marked by polysemy. Our analysis suggests readers should be less concerned by such Russian-made imitations than was suggested in much of the breathless 2016 post-election coverage, for the traction of such disinformation hinges on domestic crises and injustices that long predate Russian interference. Pointing to foreign-made social media content stokes a sense of threat and crisis--the essence of national insecurity and a main objective of the IRA's efforts--yet our actual security weaknesses are homemade.</ab>

        <ab>In 2018, the election of Jair Bolsonaro for the Brazilian presidency was associated with dubious propaganda strategies implemented through social media. The purpose of this article is to understand the early development of key communication strategies of his presidential campaign since 2016. We used a combination of observational, discourse, and content analysis based on digital trace data to investigate how Bolsonaro had been testing his campaign targets and segmentation, as well as cultivating bot accounts and botnets on Twitter during the 2016 Rio de Janeiro municipal election. Our research suggests that the automation of different supporter profiles to target potential voter identities and the experimental dissemination of divisive narratives ensured the effectiveness of his communication persuasion. This finding contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding his controversial online efforts, adding to the urgent research agenda on Brazil’s democratic setback.</ab>

        <ab>The article investigates advertising (ad) fraud where robots and not humans are clicking campaign digital ads, a scenario that frightens political consultants. Topics discussed include robots or bots being governed by automated computer programs that tell them which digital content to consume as well as bots replicating human actions. Also mentioned are control over where digital ads run being key for campaigns, knowing what to ask vendors and the clear value of online media.</ab>

        <ab>(1) The study investigated the social network surrounding the hashtags #maga (Make America Great Again, the campaign slogan popularized by Donald Trump during his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns) and #trump2020 on Twitter to better understand Donald Trump, his community of supporters, and their political discourse and activities in the political context of the 2020 US presidential election. (2) Social network analysis of a sample of 220,336 tweets from 96,820 unique users, posted between 27 October and 2 November 2020 (i.e., one week before the general election day) was conducted. (3) The most active and influential users within the #maga and #trump2020 network, the likelihood of those users being spamming bots, and their tweets' content were revealed. (4) The study then discussed the hierarchy of Donald Trump and the problematic nature of spamming bot detection, while also providing suggestions for future research.</ab>

        <ab>This study is the first to scrutinize the psychological effects of online astroturfing in the context of Russia's digitally enabled foreign propaganda. Online astroturfing is a communicative strategy that uses websites, "sock puppets," or social bots to create the false impression that a particular opinion has widespread public support. We exposed N = 2353 subjects to pro-Russian astroturfing comments and tested: (1) their effects on political opinions and opinion certainty and (2) the efficiency of three inoculation strategies to prevent these effects. All effects were investigated across three issues and from a short- and long-term perspective. Results show that astroturfing comments can indeed alter recipients' opinions, and increase uncertainty, even when subjects are inoculated before exposure. We found exclusively short-term effects of only one inoculation strategy (refutational-same). As these findings imply, preemptive media literacy campaigns should deploy (1) continuous rather than one-time efforts and (2) issue specific rather than abstract inoculation messages.</ab>

        <ab>This paper describes a 2020 disinformation campaign promoting the unsubstantiated claim that the novel coronavirus is the product of a Chinese bioweapons program. Exploiting a vulnerability in open-access scientific publishing, the campaign was based on papers posted to an online preprint repository designed to accelerate the diffusion of scientific knowledge. This provided the campaign with an air of scientific legitimacy, helped it reach millions of Americans, and muddied public discourse over the origins of SARS-CoV-2. This case study offers insights into the tactics and practices of media manipulation, the contested nature of modern epistemic systems, the interplay of technical and social systems, and the vulnerability of open systems to manipulation.</ab>

        <ab>Lava caves are the result of a geological process related to the cooling of basaltic lava flows. On the Moon, this process may lead to caves several kilometers long and diameters of hundreds of meters. Access to lava tubes can be granted through skylights, a vertical pit between the lava tube and the lunar surface. This represents an outstanding opportunity for long-term missions, for future permanent human settlements, and for accessing pristine samples of lava, secondary minerals and volatiles. Given this, the ESA launched a campaign through the Open Space Innovation Platform calling for ideas that would tackle the many challenges of exploring lava pits. Five projects, including Robocrane, were selected. Solar light and direct line of sight (for communications) with the lunar surface are not available inside lava tubes. This is a problem for any robot (or swarm of robots) exploring the lava tubes. Robocrane tackles both problems by deploying an element (called the Charging head, or CH) at the bottom of the skylight by means of a crane. This CH behaves as a battery charger and a communication relay for the exploring robots. The required energy is extracted from the crane's solar panel (on the surface) and driven to the bottom of the skylight through an electrical wire running in parallel to the crane hoisting wire. Using a crane allows the system to deal with unstable terrain around the skylight rim and protect the wires from abrasion from the rocky surface and the pit rim. The charger in the CH is wireless so that the charging process can begin as soon as any of the robots get close enough to the CH. This avoids complex and time-consuming docking operations, aggravated by the skylight floor orography. The crane infrastructure can also be used to deploy the exploring robots inside the pit, reducing their design constraints and mass budget, as the robots do not need to implement their own self-deployment system. Finally, RoboCrane includes all the sensors and actuators for remote operation from a ground station. RoboCrane has been designed in a parametric tool so it can be dynamically and rapidly adjusted to input-variable changes, such as the number of exploring robots, their electrical characteristics, and crane reach, etc. • The use of a crane for deploying robots inside the skylight alleviates their design. • The reach of the crane, for robots of several kilograms, may be as high as 25 m. • The use of a power wireless charger simplifies the charging operation and time. • A wired communication link between bottom and surface results in excessive weight. • A Rover-crane joint design is preferred given the similar mass between both.</ab>

        <ab>Swaths of personal and nonpersonal information collected online about Internet users are increasingly being used in sophisticated ways for online political manipulation. This represents a new trend in the exploitation of data, where instead of pursuing direct financial gain based on the face value of the data, actors engage in data analytics using advanced artificial intelligence technologies that allow them to more easily access individuals' cognition and future behavior. Although in recent years the concept of online manipulation has received some academic and policy attention, the desirable relationship between cybersecurity law and online manipulation is not yet fully explored. In other words, regulators and courts have yet to realize the importance of linking cybersecurity law to individual autonomy, privacy, and democracy. This Article provides an account of the desirable relationship between cybersecurity law and other values, such as autonomy, privacy, and democracy, by looking at the phenomenon of online manipulation achieved through psychographic profiling. It argues that the volume, efficacy, and sophistication of present online manipulation techniques pose a considerable and immediate danger to autonomy, privacy, and democracy. Internet actors, political entities, and foreign adversaries carefully study the personality traits and vulnerabilities of Internet users and, increasingly, target each such user with an individually tailored stream of information or misinformation with the intent of exploiting the weaknesses of these individuals. This Article makes a broader argument about cybersecurity law and its narrow focus on identity theft and financial fraud. Primarily, this Article looks at data-breach notification law, a subset of cybersecurity law, as reflective of that limited scope. It argues that data-breach notification law could provide a much-needed backdrop for the challenges presented by online manipulation, while alleviating the sense of lawlessness engulfing current misuses of personal and nonpersonal data. At the heart of this Article is an inquiry into the expansion of dated notions of cybersecurity law. Presently, cybersecurity law's narrow approach seeks to remedy materialized harms such as identity theft or fraud. This approach contravenes the purpose of cybersecurity law--to create legal norms protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and networks. If cybersecurity law seeks to protect individuals from the externalities of certain cyber risks, it needs to recognize emerging threats targeting computer systems and networks, and subsequently, individual autonomy, privacy, and democracy.</ab>

        <ab>The Facebook Ad Library promises to improve transparency and accountability in online advertising by rendering personalised campaigns visible to the public. This article investigates whether and how journalists have made use of this tool in their reporting. Our content analysis of print journalism reveals several different use cases, from high-level reporting on political campaigns to uncovering specific wrongdoings such as disinformation, hate speech, and astroturfing. However, our interviews with journalists who use the Ad Library show that they remain highly critical of this tool and its manifold limitations. We argue that these findings offer empirical grounding for the public regulation of ad archives, since they underscore both the public interest in advertising disclosures as well as the growing reliance of journalists on voluntary and incomplete access frameworks controlled by the very platforms they aim to scrutinise.</ab>

        <ab>This article collects the results of an investigation focused on the startup Politibot, a chatbot or conversational bot specialized on political contents, which turned on in Spanish during the electoral campaign of June 2016 on Telegram, that also offers to suscriptors interactive and multimedia data visualizations of data and an analysis of the voting intention based on sociological studies. Taking as starting point previous works on Politibots that shows to what extent users distinguish and value the news on bots, as well as the experience of consumption by the audience (Sánchez, H. and Sánchez M., 2017), in this study we combine techniques of research such as direct observation and analysis on data visualization through the case study method. It is investigated about its tipology and tematic and it is considered several journalistic, aesthetic and formal parameters which affect to its functionality and potential usability. It is concluded that the visualizations, as graphic and audiovisual interactive formulas, meet the journalistic objectives, favor the understanding of the information and the aesthetic functionality and propitiate the customized use and interaction of the users</ab>

        <ab>Tools such as trolls, bots and cyborgs, which are an integral part of the use of social media, began to threaten democracy with the effects of computer propaganda. For this reason, it is an important question and worth investigating whether these elements are used in communication via social media in Turkey, and to what extent they are used if they are used. The June 23, 2019 elections provide a good setting for such research. The elections of 23 June 2019 provide a good environment for such research. In this study, troll, bot and cyborg accounts were acquired in Twitter traffic in Turkey. Binali Yildirim and Ekrem Imamoglu, candidates for the 2019 June Istanbul metropolitan mayoral elections, focused on the accounts that interact with and contribute to their followers, messages, and Twitter election campaigns. The purpose of the study is to determine whether troll accounts, as well as bot and cyborg accounts, are common in Twitter traffic in Turkey. The sources from which the candidates 'hashtags were circulated by other users were realized through the GitHub TCAT open-source software. Bot or cyborg suspect accounts were encountered; The most active two of them were followed up with Gephi, the network analysis and visualization software. As a result of the research, automated accounts such as cyborg and bot were found; it was concluded that such accounts were being used not only by the followers of politicians, but also by interest groups trying to create a public agenda.</ab>

        <ab>On October 31, 2013, thousands of Twitter accounts, automated to actively retweet President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela, were unexpectedly closed by the social media platform. I exploit this event to study the relationship between perceived popularity on social media (amplified through the use of bot accounts) and online political expression. The analysis uses more than two hundred thousand tweets spanning six months around the event and employs a quasi-experimental empirical framework. Following the closure of the accounts, the volume of tweets mentioning the president increased by an estimated 33 percent, with a differential increase for critical messages. Relative to tweets by government leaders, the number of likes for tweets by opposition leaders increased by an estimated 21 percent. Consistent with the presence of a spiral of silence in online political expression, the results suggest that the change in the perceived popularity of Maduro led to an increase in users' willingness to express both criticism of the president and support for the opposition. While previous studies have documented how autocratic governments engage in manipulative online campaigns, this paper provides evidence of their effectiveness and highlights an important mechanism through which they can influence behavior.</ab>

        <ab>Within‐group competition over food resources can be a major cost of social living. In the wild, foragers are confronted with social (e.g. hierarchical rank) and ecological (e.g. food availability and distribution) challenges that affect their foraging decisions and feeding success. Exhibiting prosocial behaviours, such as tolerance at feeding sites, can benefit group members by developing affiliative social relationships, enhancing access to resources and maximizing fitness.We examined social tolerance at feeding sites in Callithrix jacchus, a cooperatively breeding primate species. We investigated the set of social (rank, age and sex) and ecological (food availability) factors that influence the structure and dynamics of within‐group foraging association networks.We designed and conducted an experimental field study of four wild groups of common marmosets in which we controlled food distribution (concentrated or scattered) and productivity (high, medium or low food rewards). Then, we used social network analyses to assess the number and strength of foraging associations among group members, their effects on individual food consumption, and whether recent experiences with conspecifics during foraging affected subsequent associations.Overall, common marmoset foraging association networks were cohesive, as group members jointly occupied feeding sites. The number and strength of associations varied depending on the ecological context. Associations were stronger during conditions in which food was concentrated at a single site. Individuals obtained greater access to food resources when sharing a feeding site with conspecifics, but once a food item was obtained, the forager moved to a nearby tree and consumed it away from others. Additionally, the strength of previous foraging associations and subsequent levels of social tolerance at feeding sites were positively related, a relationship compatible with the ability of memorizing associations over time and recalling the information in future decision‐making.In sum, marmosets adjusted their partner choices and the strength of foraging associations in response to food availability. They exhibited increased social tolerance at feeding sites during conditions in which opportunities for contest competition were expected to be greatest. These cooperative breeding primates appear to mutually benefit by maintaining cohesive and strong affiliative relationships, and by increasing opportunities for coordinated behaviour and offspring survival.</ab>

        <ab>The diffusion of opinions in social networks is a relevant process for adopting positions and attracting potential voters in political campaigns. Opinion polarization, bias, targeted diffusion, and the radicalization of postures are key elements for understanding the voting dynamics' challenges. In particular, social bots are currently a new element that can have a pronounced effect on the formation of opinions during electoral processes by, for instance, creating fake accounts in social networks to manipulate elections. Here, we propose a voter model incorporating bots and radical or intolerant individuals in the decision-making process. The dynamics of the system occur in a multiplex network of interacting agents composed of two layers, one for the dynamics of opinions where agents choose between two possible alternatives, and the other for the tolerance dynamics, in which agents adopt one of the two tolerance levels. The tolerance accounts for the likelihood to change opinion in an interaction, with tolerant (intolerant) agents switching opinion with probability 1.0 ( γ ≤ 1 ). We find that intolerance leads to a consensus of tolerant agents during an initial stage that scales as τ + ∼ γ - 1 ln N , who then reach an opinion consensus during the second stage in a time that scales as τ ∼ N , where N is the number of agents. Therefore, very intolerant agents ( γ ≪ 1 ) could considerably slow down dynamics towards the final consensus state. We also find that the inclusion of a fraction σ B - of bots breaks the symmetry between both opinions, driving the system to a consensus of intolerant agents with the bots' opinion. Thus, bots eventually impose their opinion to the entire population, in a time that scales as τ B - ∼ γ - 1 for γ ≪ σ B - and τ B - ∼ 1 / σ B - for σ B - ≪ γ .</ab>

        <ab>In the context of smart cities, it is crucial to filter out falsified information spread on social media channels through paid campaigns or bot-user accounts that significantly influence communication networks across the social communities and may affect smart decision-making by the citizens. In this paper, we focus on two major aspects of the Twitter social network associated with altmetrics: (a) to analyze the properties of bots on Twitter networks and (b) to distinguish between bots and human accounts. Firstly, we employed state-of-the-art social network analysis techniques that exploit Twitter's social network properties in novel altmetrics data. We found that 87% of tweets are affected by bots that are involved in the network's dominant communities. We also found that, to some extent, community size and the degree of distribution in Twitter's altmetrics network follow a power-law distribution. Furthermore, we applied a deep learning model, graph convolutional networks, to distinguish between organic (human) and bot Twitter accounts. The deployed model achieved the promising results, providing up to 71% classification accuracy over 200 epochs. Overall, the study concludes that bot presence in altmetrics-associated social media platforms can artificially inflate the number of social usage counts. As a result, special attention is required to eliminate such discrepancies when using altmetrics data for smart decision-making, such as research assessment either independently or complementary along with traditional bibliometric indices.</ab>

        <ab>There has been much debate in recent years about the role of the East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) in the disinformation campaign launched in the early 1980s by the Soviet State Security Committee (KGB) regarding the origin and nature of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The KGB's operation, codenamed "Denver" by the Stasi (not "Infektion," as many online sources now erroneously assert), claimed that AIDS was deliberately devised by U.S. biological warfare specialists for the U.S. government to spread in minority communities in the United States. Based on the available evidence, the Stasi's role in the AIDS disinformation campaign was limited in 1985–1986 to (1) keeping watch over Soviet-East German scientist Jakob Segal, who propagated a variant of the KGB's thesis; (2) helping to arrange for the publication and distribution of a brochure with Segal's thesis at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Harare in 1986; and (3) facilitating Segal's interviews with certain journalists. Just as important for the ongoing formulation and spread of the KGB's AIDS disinformation was a cycle of misinformation and disinformation that arose between U.S.-based conspiracy theorists—especially Lyndon LaRouche and his followers—and authors and publications espousing Moscow's preferred theses regarding AIDS.</ab>

        <ab>Twitter is a popular microblogging platform, which facilitates users to express views and thoughts on day-to-day events using short texts limited to a maximum of 280 characters. However, it is generally targeted by socialbots for political astroturfing, advertising, spamming, and other illicit activities due to its open and real-time information sharing and dissemination nature. In this paper, we present a socialbots analysis-driven graph-based approach for identifying coordinated campaigns among Twitter users. To this end, we first present statistical insights derived from the analysis of logged data of 98 socialbots, which were injected in Twitter and associated with top-six Twitter using countries. In the analysis, we study and present the impact of socialbots' profile features, such as age and gender on infiltration. We also present a multi-attributed graph-based approach to model the profile attributes and interaction behavior of users as a similarity graph for identifying different groups of synchronized users involved in coordinated campaigns. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated using four different evaluation parameters over a real dataset containing socialbots' trapped user profiles. The evaluation of identified campaigns in the form of clusters reveals the traces of spammers, botnets, and other malicious users.</ab>

        <ab>One fertile research area in IR is intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) or institutions established by different states through resource pooling to address collective action problems and foster international cooperation. In Chapter 11, Bjola shows that IGOs also suffer from "manufactured delegitimation" online, as evidenced by the disinformation campaign against the UN Global Compact for Migration, and briefly discusses how IGOs can counter such operations. IGOs are, therefore, one mechanism where the media could directly affect global politics and skirt domestic state borders, yet the current literature on IGO-media interaction continues to be thin.</ab>

        <ab>Recently we have witnessed a number of rapid shifts toward populism in the rhetoric and policies of major political parties, as exemplified in the 2016 Brexit Referendum, 2016 US Election, and 2017 UK General Election. Our perspective here is to focus on understanding the underlying societal processes behind these recent political shifts. We use novel methods to study social dynamics behind the 2016 Presidential election. This is done by using network science methods to identify key groups associated with the US right-wing during the election. We investigate how the groups grew on Twitter, and how their associated accounts changed their following behaviour over time. We find a new external faction of Trump supporters took a strong influence over the traditional Republican Party (GOP) base during the election campaign. The new group dominated the GOP group in terms of new members and endorsement via Twitter follows. Growth of new accounts for the GOP party all but collapsed during the campaign. While the Alt-right group was growing exponentially, it has remained relatively isolated. Counter to the mainstream view, we detected an unexpectedly low number of automated ‘bot’ accounts and accounts associated with foreign intervention in the Trump-supporting group. Our work demonstrates a powerful method for tracking the evolution of societal groups and reveals complex social processes behind political changes.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose - The rapid development of information technologies with social networks has created an unprecedented environment in which disinformation and related information operations are recognized as very effective and devastating weapons of mass destruction. A purpose-driven disinformation campaign in cyberspace is able to influence results of democratic elections at the level of the world superpower. This is a very serious social issue and a problem for which there is no effective defense yet. Our objective is to map current approaches to combating disinformation from the viewpoint of technology platform operators whose platforms are misused to spread misinformation and suggest a simple classification model of defensive information strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Focus is laid on how influential technology companies reacted to the landmark of the US presidential elections in 2016 in their processes, strategy and product visions. Our attention is limited to the area of social networks and limited by March 2018. This theoretical work is based on the following methodological approaches: a) Document analyses of primary sources published by individual companies being monitored. b) Media analyses of news sources covering situation from an information strategy viewpoint as well as the socio-cultural political context and triggers associated with this phenomenon. Results - Based on the analyses of selected technology companies and socio-cultural political triggers we have defined a simple classification of information strategies for combating disinformation in online platforms. With this classification we derived a first version of a functional model, that hadn't existed before. Strategy based on automated fact-checking systems with the support of artificial intelligence proofed to be the most vital. Originality/value - Content mediators, publishers and their editors, have already received a significant amount of attention in many studies and analysis following a vast historical research in the area of media and communication. On the other hand, the view of the information strategy of a communications platform operator, which we are focusing on in our work, is in this context of the online world a new and still not very well researched area that brings new questions and challenges regarding the platform management from the perspectives of information management and information policy.</ab>

        <ab>Disinformation campaigns continue to thrive online, despite social media companies' efforts at identifying and culling manipulation on their platforms. Framing these manipulation tactics as 'coordinated inauthentic behavior,' major platforms have banned culprits and deleted the evidence of their actions from social activity streams, making independent assessment and auditing impossible. While researchers, journalists, and civil society groups use multiple methods for discovering and tracking disinformation, platforms began to publish highly curated data archives of disinformation in 2016. When platform companies reframe manipulation campaigns, however, they downplay the importance of their products in spreading disinformation. We propose to treat social media metadata as a boundary object that supports research across platforms and use metadata as an entry point for investigating manipulation campaigns. We illustrate how platform companies' responses to disinformation campaigns are at odds with the interests of researchers, civil society, policy-makers, and journalists, limiting the capacity to audit the role that platforms play in political discourse. To show how platforms' data archives of 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' prevent researchers from examining the contexts of manipulation, we present two case studies of disinformation campaigns related to the Black Lives Matter Movement. We demonstrate how data craft – the exploitation of metrics, metadata, and recommendation engines – played a prominent role attracting audiences to these disinformation campaigns. Additionally, we offer some investigative techniques for researchers to employ data craft in their own research of the disinformation. We conclude by proposing new avenues for research for the field of Critical Internet Studies.</ab>

        <ab>Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate most human genes through direct base-pairing with mRNAs. We investigate the underlying principles of miRNA regulation in living cells. To this end, we overexpressed miRNAs in different cell types and measured the mRNA decay rate under a paradigm of a transcriptional arrest. Based on an exhaustive matrix of mRNA-miRNA binding probabilities, and parameters extracted from our experiments, we developed a computational framework that captures the cooperative action of miRNAs in living cells. The framework, called COMICS, simulates the stochastic binding events between miRNAs and mRNAs in cells. The input of COMICS is cell-specific profiles of mRNAs and miRNAs, and the outcome is the retention level of each mRNA at the end of 100,000 iterations. The results of COMICS from thousands of miRNA manipulations reveal gene sets that exhibit coordinated behavior with respect to all miRNAs (total of 248 families). We identified a small set of genes that are highly responsive to changes in the expression of almost any of the miRNAs. In contrast, about 20% of the tested genes remain insensitive to a broad range of miRNA manipulations. The set of insensitive genes is strongly enriched with genes that belong to the translation machinery. These trends are shared by different cell types. We conclude that the stochastic nature of miRNAs reveals unexpected robustness of gene expression in living cells. By applying a systematic probabilistic approach some key design principles of cell states are revealed, emphasizing in particular, the immunity of the translational machinery vis-a-vis miRNA manipulations across cell types. We propose COMICS as a valuable platform for assessing the outcome of miRNA regulation of cells in health and disease. Author summary: Alteration in miRNA expression occurs throughout cell differentiation, inflammation, viral infection, tumorigenesis, and other pathologies. Notwithstanding a rich body of experimental data intended to assess the outcome of miRNA alterations in cells, the underlying design principles remain obscure and fragmented. In this study, we develop a quantitative stochastic model that simulates the mRNA steady-state in view of alteration in miRNAs' abundance. We systematically analyzed the behavior of miRNA-mRNA regulation and confirm that the stochastic nature of miRNA regulation reveals unexpected robustness of cell behavior across cell types. Specifically, we expose the immunity of the translational machinery towards miRNA regulation. The developed platform, called COMICS compares the results of miRNA regulation across various cell types. Based on stochastic and probabilistic considerations, we provide a dynamic and flexible framework that quantifies the competition of miRNAs within cells in health and disease.</ab>

        <ab>There is an increase in evidence about the generation of social media content by autonomous entities called bots. These automated entities may be computerized algorithms or a human-assisted account to boost a trend or control political campaigns. People do not create bots due to malicious intent always. Several bots are benign and often play helpful roles. Detection of these bots have many implications. Most techniques available to date perform bot detection at the account level. This paper aims to uncover social bots that are active in trending events on Twitter. We have designed an automated malicious bot detection framework to serve this purpose. Our main contributions include converting unlabelled Twitter extracted trend-centric dataset to labelled dataset using semi-supervised machine learning techniques. Selection of attributes useful for bot classification using Entropy and Information Gain. Formulation of rule hierarchy after feature selection and threshold estimation of respective features. We have finalized the suspected bots after applying the rule hierarchically on the initial dataset. In addition to this, validation of the alleged bots given by the proposed framework is performed by plotting timeline tweets of suspected users, acts as an enhancement. This model is useful for bot detection in trend-centric Twitter stream. The research carried out will serve as an advancement to the successful detection of bots in trend-centric datasets.</ab>

        <ab>Social media has emerged as a powerful tool for political engagement and expression. However, state actors are increasingly leveraging these platforms to spread computational propaganda and disinformation during critical moments of public life. These actions serve to nudge public opinion, set political or media agendas, censor freedom of speech, or control the flow of information online. Drawing on data collected from the Computational Propaganda Project's 2017 investigation into the global organization of socialmedia manipulation, we examine how governments and political parties around the world are using social media to shape public attitudes, opinions, and discourses at home and abroad. We demonstrate the global nature of this phenomenon, comparatively assessing the organizational capacity and form these actors assume, and discuss the consequences for the future of power and democracy.</ab>

        <ab>This research aims to understand the persuasion techniques used in Twitter posts about COVID-19 vaccines by the different vaccine sentiments (i.e. Pro-Vaccine, Anti-Vaccine, and Neutral) using the Elaboration Likelihood Model, Social judgment Theory, and the Extended Parallel Process Model as theoretical frameworks. A content analysis was conducted on a data set of 1,000 Twitter posts. The corpus of Tweets was examined using the persuasion frameworks; tweets that were identified as emanating from bots were further examined. Results found Anti-Vaccine messages predominantly used Anecdotal stories, Humor/Sarcasm, and Celebrity figures as persuasion techniques, while Pro-Vaccine messages primarily used Information, Celebrity figures, and Participation. Results also showed the Anti-Vaccine messages primarily focused on values related to the categories of Safety, Political/Conspiracy Theories, and Choice. Finally, results revealed Anti-Vaccine messages primarily used Perceived Severity and Perceived Susceptibility, which are fear appeal elements. The findings for messages by bots were comparable to the messages in the larger corpus of tweets. Based on the findings, a response framework—Health Information Persuasion Exploration (HIPE)—is proposed to address mis/disinformation and Anti-Vaccine messaging. The results of this study and the HIPE framework can inform a national COVID-19 vaccine health campaign to increase vaccine adoption.</ab>

        <ab>This article analyses the significance of Malay politics and electorates and its relation to the political survival of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and Barisan Nasional (BN) in Malaysia. Previously, the UMNO/BN hegemony in the Malay majority and rural constituencies had been a major roadblock en route the Malaysian opposition's path to federal power. Therefore, in the 2018 General Election (GE), a new opposition pact known as the Alliance of Hope (PH) forged a strategic co-operation with Mahathir and former leaders of UMNO to establish and strengthen two new Malay-based parties; the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu) and Sabah Heritage Party (Warisan). This article argues that the ability of PH in forming a stronger, more representative and credible alliance of opposition, particularly in allowing the entrance and co-operation of the Malay-based political parties in the alliance; is a major factor in subverting BN's dominance in Malaysia. Nevertheless, this article also identifies several other main factors that led to the BN regime's failure in the election, namely: elite rupture; the presence of hot-button issues; advancement of Internet and Communication Technology (ICT); and the formation of digital/information-based society in Malaysia. These arguments, therefore, strive to explain why the former BN regime had failed to maintain federal power despite with the pervasive use of electoral manipulations by the regime and the problem of split opposition due to the withdrawal of the influential Islamic-based party (PAS) from the opposition coalition. We use the concept of competitive authoritarianism as a theoretical framework to explain the relatively competitive electoral contest within an authoritarian system, in which the ruling regime resorts to political manipulation in order to win elections.</ab>

        <ab>The weaponization of digital communications and social media to conduct disinformation campaigns at immense scale, speed, and reach presents new challenges to identify and counter hostile influence operations (IOs). This paper presents an end-to-end framework to automate detection of disinformation narratives, networks, and influential actors. The framework integrates natural language processing, machine learning, graph analytics, and a network causal inference approach to quantify the impact of individual actors in spreading IO narratives. We demonstrate its capability on real-world hostile IO campaigns with Twitter datasets collected during the 2017 French presidential elections and known IO accounts disclosed by Twitter over a broad range of IO campaigns (May 2007 to February 2020), over 50,000 accounts, 17 countries, and different account types including both trolls and bots. Our system detects IO accounts with 96% precision, 79% recall, and 96% area-under-the precision-recall (P-R) curve; maps out salient network communities; and discovers high-impact accounts that escape the lens of traditional impact statistics based on activity counts and network centrality. Results are corroborated with independent sources of known IO accounts from US Congressional reports, investigative journalism, and IO datasets provided by Twitter.</ab>

        <ab>Coordinated inauthentic behaviours online are becoming a more serious problem throughout the world. One common type of manipulative behaviour is astroturfing. It happens when an entity artificially creates an impression of widespread support for a product, policy, or concept, when in reality only limited support exists. Online astroturfing is often considered to be just like any other coordinated inauthentic behaviour; with considerable discussion focusing on how it aggravates the spread of fake news and disinformation. This paper shows that astroturfing creates additional problems for social media platforms and the online environment in general. The practice of astroturfing exploits our natural tendency to conform to what the crowd does; and because of the importance of conformity in our decision-making process, the negative consequences brought about by astroturfing can be much more far-reaching and alarming than just the spread of disinformation.</ab>

        <ab>The libertarian regulatory environment of online political advertising has come under scrutiny again, as news reports continue to come out describing the extent of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election. For years, Silicon Valley has resisted Washington, D.C.’s efforts to regulate online political advertising. Tech companies feared regulation would threaten not only their business models, but also the Internet’s status as the “most accessible marketplace of ideas in history.” But can America’s democracy continue to tolerate lax regulation of online political advertising? Overwhelming evidence of Russian operatives spreading divisive messages across online platforms during the 2016 presidential election demands a government response. In fact, Congress is now debating the Honest Ads Act, and the Federal Election Commission is considering implementing regulations to increase the transparency of online political advertisements. With the specter of regulation, Facebook, Google, and Twitter have updated their policies governing online political advertising. This Note argues that Congress should pass the Honest Ads Act, which requires disclosure for online political advertising and makes reasonable efforts to stop foreign interference with elections. Disclosure requirements are important because they provide information to voters, deter corruption, and facilitate enforcement of campaign laws. The Supreme Court has long upheld disclosure requirements, including in its controversial Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision. But disclosure requirements are likely only a partial solution. Laws and regulations may struggle to reach the trolls and bots that spread Russian disinformation during the 2016 presidential election without infringing the First Amendment. To rein in these bad actors, American democracy will have to rely on Silicon Valley to police online platforms rather than on Washington, D.C. This Note first provides an overview of the development of disclosure requirements in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. It then describes the libertarian regulatory environment of online political advertising and Silicon Valley’s efforts to self-regulate in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. Finally, the Note advocates for the passage of the Honest Ads Act and discusses the limits of regulating online political advertising.</ab>

        <ab>The use of digital propaganda during crises and elections to manipulate public opinion, suppress dissent, and diminish activists' voices has been increasingly witnessed in recent times in both developed and developing countries. Digital propaganda refers to the use of machines in addition to human users to interact with humans or run a campaign on the internet, computer and mobile devices designed to deliberately manipulate public opinion during crises or elections. While developing countries continue to have a limited internet base, this has not deterred political actors from integrating the internet into their propaganda strategies. Using Twitter data on two international conflicts between India and Pakistan – the Uri attack and the subsequent Surgical Strike – I show how online public opinion has been manipulated by a handful of sources that are driven by algorithms. Online public opinion has been able to enter the offline domain because of the contextual hybridity and the emergence of a hybrid media system. These findings reflect the limitations of public opinion in the digital age, and call attention to political polarization in the country. I discuss the need to integrate computational techniques with critical analysis of tweets and suspicious Twitter accounts to identify political bots online.</ab>

        <ab>&lt;bold&gt;Background: &lt;/bold&gt;Starting in 2019 policies restricting the availability of flavored e-cigarette products were proposed or implemented in the United States to curb vaping by youth. People took to Twitter to voice their opposition, referencing the phrase "Flavors Save Lives." This study documented the emerging themes pertaining to "Flavors Saves Lives" over a 12-month period.&lt;bold&gt;Methods: &lt;/bold&gt;The study period was from May 1, 2019, to May 1, 2020. A stratified sampling procedure supplied 2500 tweets for analysis. Posts were classified by one or more of the following themes: (1) Political Referendum; (2) Institutional Distrust; (3) Individual Rights; (4) Misinformation; (5) THC Vaping is the Real Problem; (6) Smoking Cessation; (7) Adult Use; and (8) Not a Bot. The temporal pattern of tweets over the year was examined.&lt;bold&gt;Results: &lt;/bold&gt;Political Referendum (76.5%) and Institutional Distrust (31.3%) were the most prominent themes, followed by Not a Bot (11.0%), Individual Rights (10.4%), Adult Use (8.0%), Smoking Cessation (6.6%), Misinformation (5.9%), and THC Vaping is the Real Problem (3.5%). Total tweet frequencies increased in September 2019 and peaked in November 2019 before returning to relatively low numbers. Political Referendum and Institutional Distrust were consistently the most prevalent themes over time.&lt;bold&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/bold&gt;Twitter posts with the phrase "Flavors Save Lives" commonly discussed voting against political incumbents and mentioned distrust of government representatives. Findings demonstrated the possibility of near real-time Twitter monitoring of public opposition to flavor bans. These data may be valuable for designing tobacco control information campaigns in the future.&lt;bold&gt;Implications: &lt;/bold&gt;(a) Starting in 2019 policies restricting the availability of flavored e-cigarette products were proposed or implemented in the United States to curb vaping by youth. (b) This study content analyzed Twitter posts with the phrase "Flavors Save Lives" from a 12-month period to understand opposition to flavor restrictions. (c) Twitter posts commonly discussed voting against political incumbents and mentioned distrust of government representatives. (d) Findings demonstrated the possibility of near real-time Twitter monitoring of public opposition to flavor bans, and contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of different sub-population's responses to current and proposed tobacco control information policies.</ab>

        <ab>The integration of social networking sites in the media ecosystem has boosted the adaptation of PR and marketing technics to the specific affordances of these new sites, as the pseudo-event. The case study #LaHoraMágica is analysed in this exploratory work in order to determine if the features of this new kind of encounter fit the pseudo-event’ original definition. #LaHoraMágica is a peculiar social aggregate which has daily reached the "trending topic" in the Spanish Twittersphere from 2013 until the beginning of 2016. Methodologically, this case study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results show a clear predominance of the broadcasting model in this interaction, just a 4,9% of the sample presents responses to previous tweets (N=2.760). Additionally, data indicate a selfpromotional goal shared between the event planner (who uses it as a self-branding campaign) and the online users. Thus, #LaHoraMágica embodies an example of a new tendency: the use and transformation of this technique by users as a tool to access a massive online visibility where bots are new key actors.</ab>

        <ab>Russian media have recently (re-)gained attention of the scholarly community, mostly due to the rise of cyber-attacking techniques and computational propaganda efforts. A revived conceptualization of the Russian media as a uniform system driven by a well-coordinated propagandistic state effort, though having evidence thereunder, does not allow seeing the public discussion inside Russia as a more diverse and multifaceted process. This is especially true for the Russian-language mediated discussions online, which, in the recent years, have proven to be efficient enough in raising both social issues and waves of political protest, including on-street spillovers. While, in the recent years, several attempts have been made to demonstrate the complexity of the Russian media system at large, the content and structures of the Russian-language online discussions remain seriously understudied. The thematic issue draws attention to various aspects of online public discussions in Runet; it creates a perspective in studying Russian mediated communication at the level of Internet users. The articles are selected in the way that they not only contribute to the systemic knowledge on the Russian media but also add to the respective subdomains of media research, including the studies on social problem construction, news values, political polarization, and affect in communication.</ab>

        <ab>The health of democratic public spheres is challenged by the circulation of falsehoods. These epistemic problems are connected to social media and they raise a classic problem of how to understand the role of technology in political developments. We discuss three sets of technological affordances of social media that facilitate the spread of false beliefs: obscuring the provenance of information, facilitating deception about authorship, and providing for manipulation of social signals. We argue that these do not make social media a "cause" of problems with falsehoods, but explanations of epistemic problems should account for social media to understand the timing and widespread occurrence of epistemic problems. We argue that "the marketplace of ideas" cannot be adequate as a remedy for these problems, which require epistemic editing by the press.</ab>

        <ab>Estonia is the only country in the world where all voters can vote online in national elections. In the 2015 election, 31% of voters did so. This paper discusses the sociology and politics of online voting in Estonia. I first show that online voting is a partisan project. Liberal, conservative, and social democratic parties support online voting as a way of modernizing the electoral system, while populist and agrarian parties oppose it as a tool for political manipulation. I then show that online voting is demographically and politically biased. Online voters are more urban, richer, and better-educated than conventional voters and non-voters. The opposition left-populist Center Party receives fewer votes online than the governing market-liberal Reform Party. This is a bad thing for democracy and Estonia should discontinue online voting.</ab>

        <ab>This study explores how disinformation can dampen general users’ expressions of opinion online. In the context of a proven disinformation case in South Korea, this study analyzes externally validated click-logs of 1389 fake accounts and more than a million logs of 45,769 general users in a highly popular web portal. Findings show that the inflated visibility of anti-governmental opinions in the manipulated comment space was incongruent with the overall political tone that general users had spontaneously encountered from the broader media ecosystem beyond the manipulated space. Subsequently, this opinion “climate” incongruence decreased the likelihood of commenting in the manipulated space. The study concludes that false amplification (of the opinions that the manipulators promote) and false diminution (of general users’ political expressions) work in tandem to create a distorted opinion environment.</ab>

        <ab>The recent street events in Romania have ignited a public debate on the topic of children's participation in the street protestings. The mass-media as well as thesocial mediahave generated and fueled two diverging streams of opinion: a domineeringone, maintaining that the children's presence to such actions is nothing but a genuine practical application of democracy, and a second trend, represented in contrast by a minority claiming that children and infants fetched by their parents to the site of street demonstrations have a potential of becoming victims of political manipulation, being even exposed to risks of possible violence, even in cases of peaceful protesting. In the middle between these seemingly irreconcillable positions stand the experts, who in an attempt to display balanced views, discuss both risks and benefits, ultimately leaving it to the parents' decision whether or not to take their children with them for the street demonstrations they wish to be part of.</ab>

        <ab>The emergence of the Internet has forced a reformulation of communication in all areas and at all levels. Politicians and candidates have been forced to adapt to a constantly changing environment, where the rules of one-way communication are lost, but the technical possibilities and scope of the messages are multiplied. This article makes an approach to the tools and practices of technopolitics as well as the tactical and strategic use of digital tools for organization, communication and action. To this end, it highlights the main platforms linked to the internet such as websites, social networks, instant messaging platforms and, more recently, smartphone applications for only political use. It also analyses the current trends linked to the celebration of the candidate, the use of memes, hashtags as a vertebral and transversal element in digital communication, the analysis of big data as the last frontier and the participation through (semi-)automated users or bots. From the point of view of communicative noise, two of the main problems of political communication are addressed, namely astroturfing - in all its variants - and fake news, linked to the growing discourse of hate on digital platforms. Finally, and after the analysis carried out, it is proposed what, in the opinion of the authors, are the keys to understanding the politics that are to come.</ab>

        <ab>This research sought for automated strategies of creation or diffusion of electoral propaganda in social media during Chile's 2017 presidential campaign. We collected and analyzed almost 2 million tweets that utilized election hashtags or were linked to one of the candidates or their campaigns; we also collected and analyzed 2,927 official Facebook posts of the candidates and 453,668 comments. While on Facebook the behavior was relatively normal, we discovered that on Twitter there were digital brigades who act autonomously in astroturfing campaigning during the first round of the election.</ab>

        <ab>The computational campaign suggests the exploitation and sophistication of the discourse by extracting and analyzing the electorate's personal data, as well as the automation of diffusion tasks through techniques such as bots. This new stage in political communication has also been approached from a critical perspective, that questions the change of public opinion in the network and the adaptation of political discourse depending on the audience. This article aims to approach the techniques of computational analysis deployed during the last general and regional elections in Spain. And to do so, it uses the qualitative methodology based, on the one hand, on sixteen in-depth interviews with political parties with representation in the Congress of Deputies and Castile and Leon regional Parliament (Popular Party, Socialist Party, Podemos, Citizens and United Left); and on the other hand, on non-participant observation by means of an ethnographic content analysis for the specific internal monitoring of the resources and proposals for information, interaction, cooperation and mobilization facilitated in different online resources generated by the examined parties. Even if far from the US context, campaign teams confirm the use of new tools for mobilization such as WhatsApp, and the development of strategies based on data extraction and automated messages, like bots.</ab>

        <ab>Literature on influence operations has identified metrics that are indicative of social media manipulation, but few studies have explored the lifecycle of low-quality information. We contribute to this literature by reconstructing nearly 3 million messages posted by 1 million users in the last days of the Brexit referendum campaign. While previous studies have found that on average only 4% of tweets disappear, we found that 33% of the tweets leading up to the referendum vote are no longer available. Only about half of the most active accounts that tweeted the referendum continue to operate publicly, and 20% of all accounts are no longer active. We tested whether partisan content was more likely to disappear and found more messages from the Leave campaign that disappeared than the entire universe of tweets affiliated with the Remain campaign. We compare these results with an assorted set of 45 hashtags posted in the same period and find that political campaigns present much higher ratios of user and tweet decay. These results are validated by inspecting 2 million Brexit-related tweets posted over a period of nearly 4 years. The article concludes with an overview of these findings and recommendations for future research.</ab>

        <ab>This article discusses the nature of social media mobs as an informal regulation of journalism by exploring selected cases. To a limited degree, social media mobs are already in practice without standardisation and compliance. It is therefore essential to study and theorise about the informal regulation of journalism by social media mobs than to dismiss them as useless trolls. This paper is theoretically grounded by media accountability systems and the fifth estate. The paper discusses the practical applications of the fifth estate in the informal regulation of journalism by describing mobbing cultures towards journalists such as trolling, digital vigilantism, cybermob censorship and social media mobs as the fifth estate and media accountability systems in practice. Astroturfing is presented as a challenge to these initiatives. The article zones in on social media mobs and presents four South African case studies. It was found that social media mobs are not always a unitary mass; they are as divided as the public interests that mobilise them. Four journalistic transgression categories that social media mobs respond to are (a) the quality of journalism, ethics and professional convention; (b) media independence and bias; (c) universal moralisation: hate speech, racism and classism; and (d) disinformation and fake news. These parameters are context- and time-bound.</ab>

        <ab>This article introduces a dataset on the covert use of social media to influence politics by promoting propaganda, advocating controversial viewpoints, and spreading disinformation. Influence efforts (IEs) are defined as: (i) coordinated campaigns by a state, or the ruling party in an autocracy, to impact one or more specific aspects of politics at home or in another state, (ii) through media channels, including social media, by (iii) producing content designed to appear indigenous to the target state. Our data draw on more than 1,000 media reports and 500 research articles/reports to identify IEs, track their progress, and classify their features. The data cover 78 foreign influence efforts (FIEs) and 25 domestic influence efforts (DIEs) – in which governments targeted their own citizens – against 51 different countries from 2011 through early 2021. The Influence Effort dataset measures covert information campaigns by state actors, facilitating research on contemporary statecraft.</ab>

        <ab>The influence of computational propaganda on democratic processes globally has necessitated the exploration of mitigation strategies for political brands. The risk associated with computational propaganda includes the spread of misleading information about a political brand over social networking sites through bots (i.e. automated software applications that are programmed to do certain tasks) and newsfeed algorithms at rapid speeds. Apart from bots being used to facilitate the spread of disinformation (i.e. misleading information spread with the intent to manipulate or deceive), human curators also play a role. Research into addressing computational propaganda in the field of political communication is limited, compelling the need to look to consumer brand experts for insight. The current study used semi-structured interviews of senior consumer brand social media practitioners and applied content analysis to develop a framework for mitigating online brand risk associated with computational propaganda for political brands. This computational propaganda brand risk mitigation framework proposes two approaches to curb the effects of computational propaganda, namely, a preventative approach and a recovery approach. Based on established theoretical and practical concepts, this mitigation framework could guide the easing of online brand risk and associated crises for political brands.</ab>

        <ab>Political actors are now deploying software programs called social bots that use social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter to communicate with users and manipulate their behavior, creating profound issues for Internet security. Current approaches in bot control continue to fail because social media platforms supply communication resources that allow bots to escape detection and enact influence. Bots become agents by harnessing profile settings, popularity measures, and automated conversation tools, along with vast amounts of user data that social media platforms make available. This article develops an ecological approach to thinking about bots that focuses on how social media environments propel bots into agency. This habitat-based model uses bots to expose ripe targets of intervention and innovation at the level of interface design. It also situates bots in the context of platform providers with a vested interest in interface design, revealing a range of new political problems. Most important, it invites a hybrid ethics, wherein humans and bots act together to solve problems in bot security and Internet ethics more broadly.</ab>

        <ab>Propaganda is gathering momentum today and it looks to be a crucial aspect of epistemic crisis of democracy. Many phenomena thought to be associated with propaganda in the twentieth century have emerged with new faces; fake news, disinformation, trolls, conspiracy theories, and so on. However, the theoretical debates about propaganda that occurred over the last century are mostly forgotten. This article evokes approaches that attempted to comprehend the shocking effect of propaganda between the two world wars and to explore how these can be articulated into current debates. We argue that, more than many recent arguments, the interwar debate and criticism of the twentieth century can shed more light on how we might think about propaganda today. To begin, we look at how the propaganda issue is addressed within the context of American positivist sociology and political science. Then, we evaluate the research conducted by the Frankfurt School on the tools and techniques of fascist propaganda in the United States of America. These two chapters demonstrate how addressing the problem of propaganda with different intellectual resources and methodological tool results in different insights. Following that, we relate the presence of propaganda in the new media ecology to both theoretical discussions and current concepts such as fake news, post-truth, and social media manipulation. Here we argue that propaganda retains its power in today's media and political world, and point out the shortcomings of approaches that refer to technology as a remedy to the spread of fake news.</ab>

        <ab>State-sponsored disinformation campaigns increasingly use anti-vaccine comments to not only undermine public health but to also reduce confidence and participation in a democratic society. Despite these dangers, research has not fully explored whether anti-vaccine comments can achieve these effects. To address this gap, an online survey experiment was conducted using a national sample of 1010 U.S. adults. Participants read a mainstream news article discussing the flu vaccine that included random variations of user comments adapted from a documented state-sponsored disinformation campaign. While exposure to anti-vaccine comments did not affect participants' views of vaccines or their willingness to discuss vaccines, participants holding pro-vaccine views reported lower confidence in news organizations and viewed the journalist who authored their article as less credible. These results suggest that anti-vaccine comments may produce effects that align with the goals of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, we review our study of 13 493 botlike Twitter accounts that tweeted during the UK European Union membership referendum debate and disappeared from the platform after the ballot. We discuss the methodological challenges and lessons learned from a study that emerged in a period of increasing weaponization of social media and mounting concerns about information warfare. We address the challenges and shortcomings involved in bot detection, the extent to which disinformation campaigns on social media are effective, valid metrics for user exposure, activation and engagement in the context of disinformation campaigns, unsupervised and supervised posting protocols, along with infrastructure and ethical issues associated with social sciences research based on large-scale social media data. We argue for improving researchers' access to data associated with contentious issues and suggest that social media platforms should offer public application programming interfaces to allow researchers access to content generated on their networks. We conclude with reflections on the relevance of this research agenda to public policy.</ab>

        <ab>Political bots, through astroturfing and other strategies, have become important players in recent elections in several countries. This study aims to provide researchers and the citizenry with the necessary knowledge to design strategies to identify bots and counteract what international organizations have deemed bots' harmful effects on democracy and, simultaneously, improve automatic detection of them. This study is based on two innovative methodological approaches: (1) dealing with bots using hybrid intelligence (HI), a multidisciplinary perspective that combines artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing, political science, and communication science, and (2) applying framing theory to political bots. This paper contributes to the literature in the field by (a) applying framing to the analysis of political bots, (b) defining characteristics to identify signs of automation in Spanish, (c) building a Spanish-language bot database, (d) developing a specific classifier for Spanish-language accounts, (e) using HI to detect bots, and (f) developing tools that enable the everyday citizen to identify political bots through framing.</ab>

        <ab>Drawing from conflicts observed in online communities (e.g., astroturfing and shadow banning), I extend Pietraszewski's theory to accommodate phenomena dependent on the intersubjectivity of groups, where representations of group membership (or beliefs about group membership) diverge. Doing so requires enriching representations to include other agents and their beliefs in a process of recursive mentalizing.</ab>

        <ab>Disinformation campaigns such as those perpetrated by far-right groups in the United States seek to erode democratic social institutions. Looking to understand these phenomena, previous models of disinformation have emphasized identity-confirmation and misleading presentation of facts to explain why such disinformation is shared. A risk of these accounts, which conjure images of echo chambers and filter bubbles, is portraying people who accept disinformation as relatively passive recipients or conduits. Here we conduct a case study of tactics of disinformation to show how platform design and decentralized communication contribute to advancing the spread of disinformation even when that disinformation is continuously and actively challenged where it appears. Contrary to a view of disinformation flowing within homogeneous echo chambers, in our case study we observe substantial skepticism against disinformation narratives as they form. To examine how disinformation spreads amidst skepticism in this case, we employ a document-driven multi-site trace ethnography to analyze a contested rumor that crossed anonymous message boards, the conservative media ecosystem, and other platforms. We identify two important factors that filtered out skepticism and contested explanations, which facilitated the transformation of this rumor into a disinformation campaign: (1) the aggregation of information into evidence collages—image files that aggregate positive evidence—and (2) platform filtering—the decontextualization of information as these claims crossed platforms. Our findings provide an elucidation of "trading up the chain" dynamics explored by previous researchers and a counterpoint to the relatively mechanistic accounts of passive disinformation propagation that dominate the quantitative literature. We conclude with a discussion of how these factors relate to the communication power available to disparate groups at different times, as well as practical implications for inferring intent from social media traces and practical implications for the design of social media platforms.</ab>

        <ab>Political communication is the process of putting information, technology, and media in the service of power. Increasingly, political actors are automating such processes, through algorithms that obscure motives and authors yet reach immense networks of people through personal ties among friends and family. Not all political algorithms are used for manipulation and social control however. So what are the primary ways in which algorithmic political communication—organized by automated scripts on social media—may undermine elections in democracies? In the US context, what specific elements of communication policy or election law might regulate the behavior of such “bots,” or the political actors who employ them? First, we describe computational propaganda and define political bots as automated scripts designed to manipulate public opinion. Second, we illustrate how political bots have been used to manipulate public opinion and explain how algorithms are an important new domain of analysis for scholars of political communication. Finally, we demonstrate how political bots are likely to interfere with political communication in the United States by allowing surreptitious campaign coordination, illegally soliciting either contributions or votes, or violating rules on disclosure.</ab>

Thus, there is a need to identify and eliminate "influence bots"--realistic, automated identities that illicitly shape discussions on sites like Twitter and Facebook--before they get too influential.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method to enhance the spread of messages in social networks by "Spreading Groups." These sub-structures of highly connected accounts intentionally echo messages between the members of the subgroup at the early stages of a spread. This echoing further boosts the spread to regions substantially larger than the initial region. These spreading accounts can be actual humans or social bots. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reveals an interesting anomaly in information cascades in Twitter and proposes the spreading group model that explains this anomaly. The model was tested using an agent-based simulation, real Twitter data and questionnaires. Findings: The messages of few anonymous Twitter accounts spread on average more than well-known global financial media groups, such as The Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg. The spreading groups (also sometimes called BotNets) model provides an effective mechanism that can explain these findings. Research limitations/implications: Spreading groups are only one possible mechanism that can explain the effectiveness of spread of tweets from lesser known accounts. The implication of this work is in showing how spreading groups can be used as a mechanism to spread messages in social networks. The construction of spreading groups is rather technical and does not require using opinion leaders. Similar to the case of "Fake News," we expect the topic of spreading groups and their aim to manipulate information to receive growing attention in public discussion. Practical implications: While harnessing opinion leaders to spread messages is costly, constructing spreading groups is more technical and replicable. Spreading groups are an efficient method to amplify the spread of message in social networks. Social implications: With the blossoming of fake news, one might tend to assess the reliability of news by the number of users involved in its spread. This heuristic might be easily fooled by spreading groups. Furthermore, spreading groups consisting of a blend of human and computerized bots might be hard to detect. They can be used to manipulate financial markets or political campaigns. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates an anomaly in Twitter that was not studied before. It proposes a novel approach to spreading messages in social networks. The methods presented in the paper are valuable for anyone interested in spreading messages or an agenda such as political actors or other agenda enthusiasts. While social bots have been widely studied, their synchronization to increase the spread is novel.</ab>

        <ab>A 2016 review of literature about automation, algorithms and politics identified China as the foremost area in which further research was needed because of the size of its population, the potential for Chinese algorithmic manipulation in the politics of other countries, and the frequency of exportation of Chinese software and hardware. This paper contributes to the small body of knowledge on the first point (domestic automation and opinion manipulation) and presents the first piece of research into the second (international automation and opinion manipulation). Findings are based on an analysis of 1.5 million comments on official political information posts on Weibo and 1.1 million posts using hashtags associated with China and Chinese politics on Twitter. In line with previous research, little evidence of automation was found on Weibo. In contrast, a large amount of automation was found on Twitter. However, contrary to expectations and previous news reports, no evidence was found of pro-Chinese-state automation on Twitter. Automation on Twitter was associated with anti-Chinese-state perspectives and published in simplified Mandarin, presumably aimed at diasporic Chinese and mainland users who 'jump the wall' to access blocked platforms. These users come to Twitter seeking more diverse information and an online public sphere but instead they find an information environment in which a small number of anti-Chinese-state voices are attempting to use automation to dominate discourse. Our understanding of public conversation on Twitter in Mandarin is extremely limited and, thus, this paper advances the understanding of political communication on social media.</ab>

        <ab>Online financial content is widespread on social media, especially on Twitter. The possibility to access open, real-time data about stock market information and firms' public reputation can bring competitive advantages to industry insiders. However, as many studies extensively demonstrated before, manipulative campaigns by social bots do not spare the financial sector either. In this work, we show that the more viral a stock is on Twitter, the more that virality is artificially caused by social bots. This result is also confirmed when considering accounts suspended by Twitter instead of bots. Starting from this finding, we then propose two methods for detecting the presence and the extent of financial disinformation on Twitter, via classification and regression. Our systems exploit hundreds of features to encode the characteristics of viral discussions, including features about: participating users, textual content of shared posts, temporal patterns of diffusion, and financial information about stocks. We experiment with different combinations of algorithms and features, achieving excellent results for the detection of financial disinformation (F 1 = 0. 97) and promising results for the challenging task of estimating the extent of inorganic activity within financial discussions ( R 2 = 0. 81 , M A E = 4. 9 %). Our compelling results pave the way for the deployment of novel systems for protecting against financial disinformation. • The more viral a financial discussion is, the more social bots participate in it. • The best model for detecting inorganic financial discussions achieved F1 = 0.97. • Detection on the extent of inorganic financial content achieved R2 = 0.81. • User, discussion, and financial-derived features proved to be highly informative.</ab>

        <ab>Simple Summary: Automatic behavior monitoring, also called automated analytics or automated reporting, is the ability of an analytics platform to auto-detect relevant insights—anomalies, trends, patterns—and deliver them to users in real time, without users having to manually explore their data to find the answers they need. An analytics platform with automated behavior monitoring uses algorithms to auto-analyze datasets to search for notable changes in data. It then generates alerts at fixed intervals or triggers (thresholds), and delivers the findings to each user, ready-made. In-aquaculture scoring of behavioral indicators of aquatic animal welfare is challenging, but the increasing availability of low-cost technology now makes the automated monitoring of behavior feasible. Crustacean farming is a fast-growing sector and has contributed to improving incomes. Many studies have focused on how to improve crustacean production. Information about crustacean behavior is important in this respect. Manual methods of detecting crustacean behavior are usually infectible, time-consuming, and imprecise. Therefore, automatic growth situation monitoring according to changes in behavior has gained more attention, including acoustic technology, machine vision, and sensors. This article reviews the development of these automatic behavior monitoring methods over the past three decades and summarizes their domains of application, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the challenges of individual sensitivity and aquaculture environment for future research on the behavior of crustaceans are also highlighted. Studies show that feeding behavior, movement rhythms, and reproduction behavior are the three most important behaviors of crustaceans, and the applications of information technology such as advanced machine vision technology have great significance to accelerate the development of new means and techniques for more effective automatic monitoring. However, the accuracy and intelligence still need to be improved to meet intensive aquaculture requirements. Our purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the state of the art of automatic monitoring of crustacean behaviors, pursuant of supporting the implementation of smart crustacean farming applications.</ab>

        <ab>Behavior sampling is commonly applied to represent a complete picture of animal behavior. Traditional sampling methods often fail to capture complete sequences of events, diurnal behavior, or behavior patterns. As digital technologies allow more frequent collection of behavior, there is a need to understand if the potential increase in sampling frequency yields an increase in the knowledge we gain from additional observations. In this study, 24-h behavior was labelled for three individually housed research piglets, creating a ground truth dataset. An ethogram with five categories (resting, consumption, maintenance, exploratory, and social interactions) including 23 behavior labels was applied for behavior observation for every frame in the video data set. Using Python to automatically sample behavior data from the complete dataset, the results of instantaneous and continuous sampling strategies at various sampling intervals and times of day were compared with the ground truth continuous data set using a two-sample t-test for: (a) total percentage of observations, (b) average bout length, and (c) normalized number of occurrences. Results were considered significant for alpha&lt; 0.05, which indicated a sampling method was different from ground truth. Continuously sampled data were collected at the start of each hour for 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20-min periods. Instantaneously sampled data were collected at the intervals: 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40-s; 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 60-min. Every sampling strategy resulted in misrepresentation of behavior. For example, results for the 1-s instantaneous sampling method (every 15th frame versus every frame) revealed that seven of the 23 behaviors observed were misrepresented in at least one metric: (a) total percentage of observations [P=0.027 (drinking behavior); P=0.027 (sham chewing), P=0.011 (head tossing)]; (b) average bout length [P=0.033 (feeding behavior), P=0.032 (nosing), P=0.040 (exploring pen), P=0.039 (head tossing)]; and (c) normalized number of occurrences [P=0.005 (exploring pen), P=0.018 (head tossing)].</ab>

        <ab>• A comprehensive survey on social bot detection from a social network perspective. • A refined taxonomy of social bot detection techniques is presented. • Strengths and limitations of detection approaches are discussed. • Countermeasures and future research directions are identified. Social bots represent a new generation of bots that make use of online social networks (OSNs) as command and control (C&amp;C) channels. Malicious social bots have been used as tools for launching large-scale spam campaigns, promoting low-cap stocks, manipulating users' digital influence, and conducting political astroturfing. Recent studies in this area either focus only on general security issues related to social networks or on coarse-grained categorization to support detection approaches. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive analysis from a social network perspective. To this end, we first categorize social bot attacks at different stages, then provide an overview of different types of social bots. Next, we propose a refined taxonomy that shows how different techniques within a category are related or differ from each other, followed by a detailed discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method. Following this, we review the existing datasets and summarize the results of empirical investigations. Finally, we highlight the limitations of existing detection approaches and suggest future directions for further improvement. Our study should help OSN administrators and researchers understand the destructive potential of malicious social bots and improve upon the current defensive strategies.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this study was to analyse the media discourse about the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter. The study design used in this study is data scraping, media analysis, social network analysis, and botometer. We collected 221,922 tweets containing '#AstraZeneca' from 1 January 2021 to 22 March 2021. From 50,080 tweets in the English language, we analysed the linked media sources and conducted a network detection study. We found that the most frequently retweeted tweets were full of negative information, and in many cases came from media sources that are well-known for misinformation. Our analysis identified large coordination networks involved in political astroturfing and vaccine diplomacy in South Asia but also vaccine advocacy networks associated with European Commission employees. The results of this study show that Twitter discourse about #AstraZeneca is filled with misinformation and bad press, and may be distributed not only organically by anti-vaxxer activists but also systematically by professional sources.</ab>

SP 6 sp The scholarly literature details a complex web of state, non-state, and commercial players in an equally diverse lexicon around misinformation, disinformation, psychological operations, computational propaganda, political war, and information warfare. SP 7 sp While means and motives range from political influence to financial gain, all actors benefit from advances in online technology, which deliver applied advertising techniques through micro-targeted messages to strategic populations. And while the business community largely has been spared this attention, the tendency of some of Australia's states and territories seeking investment agreements with China, including on the Belt and Road Initiative, reveals significant tensions between federal and local levels of government.</ab>

        <ab>Within the scientific community, much attention has focused on improving communications between scientists, policy makers, and the public. To date, efforts have centered on improving the content, accessibility, and delivery of scientific communications. Here we argue that in the current political and media environment faulty communication is no longer the core of the problem. Distrust in the scientific enterprise and misperceptions of scientific knowledge increasingly stem less from problems of communication and more from the widespread dissemination of misleading and biased information. We describe the profound structural shifts in the media environment that have occurred in recent decades and their connection to public policy decisions and technological changes. We explain how these shifts have enabled unscrupulous actors with ulterior motives increasingly to circulate fake news, misinformation, and disinformation with the help of trolls, bots, and respondent-driven algorithms. We document the high degree of partisan animosity, implicit ideological bias, political polarization, and politically motivated reasoning that now prevail in the public sphere and offer an actual example of how clearly stated scientific conclusions can be systematically perverted in the media through an internet-based campaign of disinformation and misinformation. We suggest that, in addition to attending to the clarity of their communications, scientists must also develop online strategies to counteract campaigns of misinformation and disinformation that will inevitably follow the release of findings threatening to partisans on either end of the political spectrum.</ab>

        <ab>This paper examines the regulation of technology platform companies providing a platform for user-generated media content while playing an increasingly dominant role in the global flow of news and information. In doing so, platform companies play a crucial role in modern civic life, by deciding which content will reach users, engage the public's attention, and be deemed credible. It is therefore crucial that we choose means of regulation that foster democratic values and robust civic engagement. In this paper we focus on the regulation of 'computational propaganda', including misinformation and 'fake news', the rise of synthetic media and so-called 'deep fakes', and novel forms of algorithmic injustice, such as the manipulation of search engine results and their effect on elections. We argue that many existing regulations fall short in that they adopt an approach that views regulation as a battle between two competing powers, or 'empires' – that of the regulatory state versus the big tech companies. Accordingly, they approach regulation as a means of redistributing power between these two players, while discounting the end user, and they often involve unjustified restrictions of free speech through the imposition of content controls.</ab>

Findings suggested that positivity and networking strategies have significant associations with dimensions of trust. Strategic implications are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Many machine-controlled Twitter accounts (also called “Sybils”) are created each day to provide services, flood out messages for astroturf political campaigns, write fake product reviews, or produce an underground marketplace for purchasing Twitter followers, retweets, or URL advertisements. In addition, fake identities and user accounts in online communities are resources used by adversaries to spread malware, spam, and harmful links over social networks. In social networks, Sybil detectors rely on the assumption that Sybils will find it harder to befriend real users; thus, Sybils that are connected to each other form strongly connected subgraphs, which can be detected using the graph theory. However, a majority of Sybils have actually successfully integrated themselves into real social media user communities (such as Twitter and Facebook). In this study, we compared the current methods used for detecting Sybil accounts. We also explored the detection features of various types of Twitter Sybil accounts in order to build an effective and practical classifier. To evaluate our classifier, we collected and manually labeled a dataset of Twitter accounts, including human users, bots, and hybrids (i.e., tweets posted by both human and bots). We consider that this Twitter Sybils corpus will help researchers to conduct high-quality measurement studies. We also developed a browser plug-in, which utilizes our classifier and warns the user about possible Sybil accounts before accessing or following them after clicking on a Twitter account.</ab>

In this campaign, Internet users can interact with a chatbot called Fabi. From a pragmatic approach to communication, we study the characteristics of the narrative supposedly based on personal experiences told by the bot as well as the interactive aspects, taking into account the circularity and equifinality principles associated with human interactions (WATZLAWICK, HELMICK-BEAVIN e JACKSON, 1992). Our objective is to analyze how chatbots can create a "conversational narrative" with a persuasive purpose.</ab>

        <ab>• Background information on social spam and the spamming process. • Social spam taxonomy comprising spam content and spammer account is outlined. • A review of social spam, Deepfakes, and spammer detection techniques is presented. • Several challenges, open issues, and future research directions are discussed. Online Social Networks are perpetually evolving and used in plenteous applications such as content sharing, chatting, making friends/followers, customer engagements, commercials, product reviews/promotions, online games, and news, etc. The substantial issues related to the colossal flood of social spam in social media are polarizing sentiments, impacting users' online interaction time, degrading available information quality, network bandwidth, computing power, and speed. Simultaneously, groups of coordinated automated accounts/bots often use social networking sites to spread spam, rumors, bogus reviews, and fake news for targeted users or mass communication. The latest developments in the form of artificial intelligence-enabled Deepfakes have exacerbated these issues at large. Consequently, it becomes extremely relevant to review recent work concerning social spam and spammer detection to counter this issue and its effect. This paper provides a brief introduction to social spam, the spamming process, and social spam taxonomy. The comprehensive review entails several dimensionality reduction techniques used for feature selection/extraction, features used, various machine learning and deep learning techniques used for social spam and spammer detection, and their merits and demerits. Artificial intelligence and deep learning empowered Deepfake (text, image, and video) spam, and their countermeasures are also explored. Furthermore, meticulous discussions, existing challenges, and emerging issues such as robustness of detection systems, scalability, real-time datasets, evade strategies used by spammers, coordinated inauthentic behavior, and adversarial attacks on machine learning-based spam detectors, etc., have been discussed with possible directions for future research.</ab>

        <ab>Political communication increasingly takes on visual forms. Yet, despite their ubiquity in everyday communication and digital campaigning, the use of these visuals remains critically understudied. In this article, we investigate the formats and modes of visual content deployed by Twitter users over a two-week period leading up to the 2019 EU Parliamentary elections and across two publics: those discussing the election at large and those discussing the more contentious issue of EU membership. Conducting a multilingual, cross-comparative content and thematic analysis of a sample of 1,097 images, we find that: (1) Visuals originating from traditional political actors prevailed among both Twitter discourses; (2) users shared substantial amounts of anti-EU, populist and, to a lesser extent, extremist images, though this content remained largely disjointed from the mainstream public debate; and (3) political humor emerged as a vector for anti-establishment and Eurosceptic themes, especially in discussions critical of the European project. We discuss the implications of our findings for the study of visual political communication and social media manipulation.</ab>

        <ab>Cass Sunstein details intrinsic flaws in group discussion, even in ideal deliberation, and draws attention to prediction markets and information-aggregation devices on the internet as supplements to discussion. I respond that the supposed flaws do not affect ideal deliberation, and that the evaluation of group discussion is too pessimistic: there are alternative hypotheses to account for his findings, and there are doubts about their external validity. Also, I contend that his evaluation of prediction markets and internet devices is too optimistic. The markets have failed miserably, and the internet is vulnerable to astroturfing by the powerful and wealthy.</ab>

        <ab>Civil society research can be categorized into a school in the tradition of Gramsci focusing on social movements and a Tocquevillean school focusing on associations and social capital. The author reviews both schools' research on the Japanese case and analyse a number of pro-nuclear citizen groups built up by the Japanese nuclear industry. The author analyses their financial data and historical development to demonstrate that they have been built up as countermovement by the nuclear industry. The author traces their mobilization processes to criticize the social capital approach. In Japanese political science, traditionally a dense web of hierarchical associations and ties of obligation have been seen as enforcing clientelism and top-down political control. This makes Japan an interesting case for the social capital approach. Social capital researchers have reinterpreted hierarchical networks as indicators of a strong civil society. Taking into account Bourdieu's notion of social capital challenges this view and supports arguments of state influence forwarded by parts of the Gramscian school.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines some of the ethical issues involved in competitive intelligence activities on the Internet. We discuss the importance of an ethical framework for the performance of competitive intelligence, especially the Code of Ethics of SCIP (the leading professional association for strategic and competitive professionals), in the context of today's networked global environment. The virtual borderlines separating national economic and military territories online are becoming increasingly hard to determine, and a variety of intelligence activities now impact organizations of every size. We describe how competitive intelligence is often practiced by employees and firms with no clear understanding of the legal and public relations problems that various ill-advised initiatives may create for both individuals and the organization, inasmuch as the Internet greatly facilitates the use of sophisticated software products without correspondingly sophisticated ethical perspectives. Specifically, we offer two mundane and seemingly minor examples of how the uninformed use of microtasking software such as Field Agent and identity misrepresentation software such as Persona Management may actually be detrimental to the existence of an ethical organizational culture. We concludes by offering suggestions as to how to help employees "program" themselves into being effective and ethical CI "agents" for their organizations.</ab>

        <ab>One communication approach that lately has become more common is astroturfing, which has been more prominent since the proliferation of social media platforms. In this context, astroturfing is a fake grass-roots political campaign that aims to manipulate a certain audience. This exploratory research examined how effective astroturfing is in mitigating citizens' natural defenses against politically persuasive messages. An experimental method was used to examine the persuasiveness of social media messages related to coal energy in their ability to persuade citizens', and increase their level of nationalism. The results suggest that citizens are more likely to be persuaded by an astroturfed message than people who are exposed to a non-astroturfed message, regardless of their political leanings. However, the messages were not successful in altering an individual's nationalistic views at the moment of exposure. The authors discuss these findings and propose how in a long-term context, astroturfing is a dangerous addition to persuasive communication.</ab>

        <ab>This paper aims to extend our understanding of what it means to approach second language acquisition by examining ways in which language knowledge is transferred from one person to another (and from other media such as online learning). In the last decades the subject of acquiring a new language came into the field of interest of psychologists, philosophers, teachers and new concepts like to live a language or to dream in a language occupied wide fields of research. The findings of the study suggest that language has become a subject of reflection about the mental processes, the content of teaching, teacher-learner relationships, the teaching methodology, and the contrasts between native and non-native speakers. A first assumption here is that the fate of languages was always related to the political decisions and second language acqusition has faced some major political decision in the last decades, such as the collapse of Soviet Union and Former Yugoslavia, which represents in my opinion the most visible poles of linguistic reorientation and start of linguistic nationalism. Seen as a carrier of identity, the language could easily become a source of political manipulation and a symbol of one nation (unity) as well. A second assumption is that it should be possible to distinguish new approaches on languages and second language acquisition by understanding them in the light of new theories, such as functionalism and cognitive brain sciences. From Saussure to Chomsky or from Fillmore and Chafe to Halliday a lot of linguistic models have been developed suggesting new and interesting ways of thinking about language and second language acquisition. A third assumption is that the methodology of studying different languages, and teaching and learning strategies have become a key issue for language teacher education presupposes an understanding of what specifically it implies in approaching second language acquisition. We will take in consideration some new approaches in second language acquisition: contrastive analysis as a way to transfer information form one language into another, the role of disputes in building up arguments, learning a new language with humor and the role of multimedia resources in second language acquisition.</ab>

        <ab>Background AirSeal™ is a novel class of valve-free insufflation system that enables a stable pneumoperitoneum with continuous smoke evacuation and carbon dioxide (CO2) recirculation during laparoscopic surgery. Comparison data to standard CO2 pressure pneumoperitoneum insufflators is scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential advantages of AirSeal™ compared to a standard CO2 insufflator. Methods/Design This is a single center randomized controlled trial comparing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery and hernia repair with AirSeal™ (group A) versus a standard CO2 pressure insufflator (group S). Patients are randomized using a web-based central randomization and registration system. Primary outcome measures will be operative time and level of postoperative shoulder pain by using the visual analog score (VAS). Secondary outcomes include the evaluation of immunological values through blood tests, anesthesiological parameters, surgical side effects and length of hospital stay. Taking into account an expected dropout rate of 5%, the total number of patients is 182 (n = 91 per group). All tests will be two-sided with a confidence level of 95% (P &lt;0.05). Discussion The duration of an operation is an important factor in reducing the patient's exposure to CO2 pneumoperitoneum and its adverse consequences. This trial will help to evaluate if the announced advantages of AirSeal™, such as clear sight of the operative site and an exceptionally stable working environment, will facilitate the course of selected procedures and influence operation time and patients clinical outcome.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the dark side of news community forums: the proliferation of opinion manipulation trolls. In particular, it explores the idea that a user who is called a troll by several people is likely to be one. It further demonstrates the utility of this idea for detecting accused and paid opinion manipulation trolls and their comments as well as for predicting the credibility of comments in news community forums.Design/methodology/approach The authors are aiming to build a classifier to distinguish trolls vs regular users. Unfortunately, it is not easy to get reliable training data. The authors solve this issue pragmatically: the authors assume that a user who is called a troll by several people is likely to be such, which are called accused trolls. Based on this assumption and on leaked reports about actual paid opinion manipulation trolls, the authors build a classifier to distinguish trolls vs regular users.Findings The authors compare the profiles of paid trolls vs accused trolls vs non-trolls, and show that a classifier trained to distinguish accused trolls from non-trolls does quite well also at telling apart paid trolls from non-trolls.Research limitations/implications The troll detection works even for users with about 10 comments, but it achieves the best performance for users with a sizable number of comments in the forum, e.g. 100 or more. Yet, there is not such a limitation for troll comment detection.Practical implications The approach would help forum moderators in their work, by pointing them to the most suspicious users and comments. It would be also useful to investigative journalists who want to find paid opinion manipulation trolls.Social implications The authors can offer a better experience to online users by filtering out opinion manipulation trolls and their comments.Originality/value The authors propose a novel approach for finding paid opinion manipulation trolls and their posts.</ab>

        <ab>Social media platforms provide people all over the world with an unprecedented ability to organize around social and political causes. However, these same platforms enable organized actors to engineer fabricated social movements to advance their agenda. Such movements leverage a variety of tools and techniques, ranging from simple spam operations to sophisticated efforts involving numerous orchestrated accounts coordinated across linguistic and cultural clusters. While the former category is straightforward to analyze via data mining methods, campaigns in the latter category are engineered to mask their true nature from the public. We build on existing work to formalize a framework to detect coordination phenomena in the second category, based on anomalies in three key dimensions of participant behavior: network, temporal, and semantic. We test this framework on three case studies and find that, in all three cases, the framework enables us to detect coordination as behavioral anomaly.</ab>

        <ab>This article examines the interplay between the creation of ‘meme factories’ by political elites, and their operationalisation through WhatsApp. It uses the case study of Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s (Jokowi’s) bid for re-election in 2019 to argue that political elites are leveraging meme culture’s association with popular voice to ‘astroturf’ public discourse, and that WhatsApp’s unique infrastructure advances that project. Drawing on interview data, we offer a holistic picture of the processes and structures implicated in this instance of astroturfing, with a focus on how WhatsApp is positioned within them. The authors’ access to campaigners affords a rare inside view of these processes and structures, and contributes to a growing body of work on the WhatsAppification of election campaigns globally. In addition, the article builds on scholarship on social media election campaigning in Indonesia by drawing attention to the role WhatsApp’s unique features play in surreptitiously influencing public discourse.</ab>

        <ab>This article explores interpersonal and human-computer interaction in the era of big data through the lens of Martin Buber's relational ethics. Doing theory otherwise, it analyses the importance of other voices and speech through the case of digital assistants, questioning the implications of naming them 'companions'. Following recent proposals to ascribe legal subjectivity to synthetic agents, the article explores the effects on agency, interaction with flesh-and-blood others and democracy in an attention economy enmeshed with technologies of behavioural manipulation powered by users' utterances that enable novel forms of social control by owners of the means of communication.</ab>

        <ab>In this article, we examine two interrelated hashtag campaigns that formed in response to the Victorian State Government's handling of Australia's most significant COVID-19 second wave of mid-to-late 2020. Through a mixed-methods approach that includes descriptive statistical analysis, qualitative content analysis, network analysis, computational sentiment analysis and social bot detection, we reveal how a small number of hyper-partisan pro- and anti-government campaigners were able to mobilise ad hoc communities on Twitter, and – in the case of the anti-government hashtag campaign – co-opt journalists and politicians through a multi-step flow process to amplify their message. Our comprehensive analysis of Twitter data from these campaigns offers insights into the evolution of political hashtag campaigns, how actors involved in these specific campaigns were able to exploit specific dynamics of Twitter and the broader media and political establishment to progress their hyper-partisan agendas, and the utility of mixed-method approaches in helping render the dynamics of such campaigns visible.</ab>

        <ab>This study explains how bots interact with human users and influence conversational networks on Twitter. We analyze a high-stakes political environment, the UK general election of May 2015, asking human volunteers to tweet from purpose-made Twitter accounts--half of which had bots attached--during three events: the last Prime Minister's Question Time before Parliament was dissolved (#PMQs), the first leadership interviews of the campaign (#BattleForNumber10), and the BBC Question Time broadcast of the same evening (#BBCQT). Based on previous work, our expectation was that our intervention would make a significant difference to the evolving network, but we found that the bots we used had very little effect on the conversation network at all. There are economic, social, and temporal factors that impact how a user of bots can influence political conversations. Future research needs to account for these forms of capital when assessing the impact of bots on political discussions.</ab>

        <ab>Online product reviews are influential sources of information that some companies attempt to manipulate by compensating reviewers for favorable comments. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has mandated disclosure of reviewer compensation to address this potential conflict of interest, but the effect of such disclosures on consumer attitudes is unknown. By extending prominence–interpretation theory, this work reconciles conflicting empirical results by introducing two novel elements of prominence (i.e., proximity and embedding) and demonstrating the effect disclosures have on reviewer credibility through two experiments (N = 750). The effects of social consensus and prior warnings on how consumers interpret disclosures are also studied. Using a general population sample (N = 346), Experiment 1 demonstrated that proximity to review increased disclosure prominence while embedding the disclosure in the review decreased disclosure prominence. More prominent disclosures reduced reviewer credibility, but less prominent disclosures had no effect. Using a student sample (N = 404), Experiment 2 demonstrated that disclosure interpretation is affected by prior warnings about conflicts of interest and the consensus of other reviews. When there was disagreement between reviews and prior warnings were provided, disclosures reduced reviewer credibility, but when there was a consensus of positive reviews or no consensus information was provided, disclosures had no effect. Our studies show that both prominence and interpretation are important to consider in understanding the effects of disclosure statements. However, variables associated with prominence produced the most robust results. The theoretical implications of these results and the practical implications for consumers, companies, and policymakers are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The interference of so-called social bots in election campaigns has led to public outcries and heavy news coverage about the danger of social bots all over the world. Learning about social bots from news coverage may crucially influence media users' fears from social bots and may undermine trust in online political processes altogether. These negative societal effects may be prevented by mass-mediated information to support literacy about social bots. Using two separate laboratory experiments, we investigated whether mass-mediated textual (Study 1) or audiovisual (Study 2) information to support literacy about social bots reduced perceived threats from bots. Across both studies, we found that news reports about social bots in election campaigns, which do not convey information to support literacy, increased news consumers' perceived threats for their online political information behavior. In contrast, when news reports included information to support literacy about social bots, these threats were reduced, which could be explained by an increase of perceived behavioral control. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. • News coverage about social bots influences perceived threats from bots. • Mass-mediated information to support literacy increases perceived bot control. • Perceived bot control decreases perceived personal threats from social bots. •Perceived bot control does not influence perceived societal threats from social bots.</ab>

        <ab>The berry of Physalis peruviana L. (Solanaceae) represents an important socio-economical commodity for Latin America. The absence of a clear phenotype renders it difficult to trace its place of origin. In this study, Cape gooseberries from eight different regions within the Peruvian Andes were profiled for their metabolism implementing a NMR platform. Twenty-four compounds could be unequivocally identified and sixteen quantified. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test revealed that all of the quantified metabolites changed significantly among regions: Bambamarca I showed the most accumulated significant differences. The coefficient of variation demonstrated high phenotypic plasticity for amino acids, while sugars displayed low phenotypic plasticity. Correlation analysis highlighted the closely coordinated behavior of the amino acid profile. Finally, PLS-DA revealed a clear separation among the regions based on their metabolic profiles, accentuating the discriminatory capacity of NMR in establishing significant phytochemical differences between producing regions of the fruit of P. peruviana L.</ab>

        <ab>To address the dual need to examine the weaponization of social media and the nature of non-Western propaganda, this article explores the use of Twitter bots in the Gulf crisis that began in 2017. Twitter account-creation dates within hashtag samples are used as a primary indicator for detecting Twitter bots. Following identification, the various modalities of their deployment in the crisis are analyzed. It is argued that bots were used during the crisis primarily to increase negative information and propaganda from the blockading countries toward Qatar. In terms of modalities, this study reveals how bots were used to manipulate Twitter trends, promote fake news, increase the ranking of anti-Qatar tweets from specific political figures, present the illusion of grassroots Qatari opposition to the Tamim regime, and pollute the information sphere around Qatar, thus amplifying propaganda discourses beyond regional and national news channels.</ab>

        <ab>It is evident that users are permanently and ubiquitously connected to the network through their mobile devices. As a consequence, they can access to an extraordinary quantity of information. Journalism has tools that, by using artificial intelligence and instant messaging systems, send filtered and personalized information to users. These systems are the so called chat bots or conversational applications. While the big media companies are developing their own applications via Messenger or Telegram, there also exist other companies that provide this type of services. That is the case of Politibot, a service that was launched during the June 2016 election campaign in Spain and which had gained 8,400 subscribers a month later. This paper analyzes this case in order to determine the way audiences perceive and consider bots news. To do so, we apply, among other techniques, observation of Politibots publications via Telegram, survey of users and analysis of social media feedback. We aim to answer questions such as how users differentiate and value bots news, how conversation in these platforms is produced, and how to collect more reliable data from them. Results show that information quality (73.1% of answers) and the emotional connection they establish with the tool (26, 8%) are the main potential of these formulas, which are becoming in an opportunity for journalism.</ab>

        <ab>The Internet of Things (IoT) and Demand Response (DR) combined have transformed the way Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) contribute to saving energy and reducing costs, while also giving consumers more control over their energy footprint. Unlike current price and incentive based DR strategies, we propose a DR model that promotes consumers reaching coordinated behaviour towards more sustainable (and green) communities. A cooperative DR system is designed not only to bolster energy efficiency management at both home and district levels, but also to integrate the renewable energy resource information into the community's energy management. Initially conceived in a centralised way, a data collector called the "aggregator" will handle the operation scheduling requirements given the consumers' time preferences and the available electricity supply from renewables. Evaluation on the algorithm implementation shows feasible computational cost (CC) in different scenarios of households, communities and consumer behaviour. Number of appliances and timeframe flexibility have the greatest impact on the reallocation cost. A discussion on the communication, security and hardware platforms is included prior to future pilot deployment.</ab>

        <ab>The Internet certainly disrupted our understanding of what communication can be, who does it, how, and to what effect. What constitutes the Internet has always been an evolving suite of technologies and a dynamic set of social norms, rules, and patterns of use. But the shape and character of digital communications are shifting again--the browser is no longer the primary means by which most people encounter information infrastructure. The bulk of digital communications are no longer between people but between devices, about people, over the Internet of things. Political actors make use of technological proxies in the form of proprietary algorithms and semiautomated social actors--political bots--in subtle attempts to manipulate public opinion. These tools are scaffolding for human control, but the way they work to afford such control over interaction and organization can be unpredictable, even to those who build them. So to understand contemporary political communication--and modern communication broadly--we must now investigate the politics of algorithms and automation.</ab>

        <ab>The article discusses astroturfing, a process in which an orchestrated campaign is made to look as though it has spontaneous support. An example is given of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry's funding of patient support groups that lobby for public funds to pay for their health insurance programs. Topics include a brief overview of astroturfing's notoriety and the role the Internet plays in its success.</ab>

        <ab>In the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the notion of "fake news" and Russian election interference became somewhat interchangeable. We argue that "fake news" insufficiently describes the Russian disinformation campaign. Our analysis of Facebook ad texts shows that they incorporate emotional appeals differently at unique moments in the political campaign of 2016. We use sentiment analysis to demonstrate the use of positive and negative emotional messages. Sentiment ratings dipped to more negative scores before the November 2016 election and rose to new positive heights after the election. This provides some evidence that the varying uses of positive sentiment and negative sentiment may have been strategic.</ab>

        <ab>Animal behavior is greatly influenced by interaction between peers as well as with the environment. Understanding the flow of information between individuals can help decipher their behavior. This applies to both the microscopic and macroscopic levels, from cellular communication to coordinated actions by humans. The aim of this work is to provide a simple but sufficient model of information propagation to learn from natural coordinated behavior, and apply this knowledge to engineered systems. We develop a probabilistic model to infer the information propagation in a network of communicating agents with different degrees of interaction affinity. Another focus of the work is estimating the time needed to reach an agreement between all agents. We experiment using swarms of robots to emulate the communication of biological and social media groups for which we are able to provide upper bounds for the time needed to reach a global consensus, as well as to identify individuals that are responsible for slow convergence.</ab>

        <ab>Reflecting on Edward Snowden’s whistle-blowing revelations regarding indiscriminate online and telephone surveillance and social media manipulation by signals intelligence agencies, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, this article highlights the hitherto limited nature of public knowledge of, and internationally uneven concern regarding, intelligence agencies’ contemporary techniques of communications surveillance and manipulative agenda building. While noting that the interdisciplinary field of intelligence studies has started to theorize intelligence agencies’ agenda-building activities, also observable is a remarkable lacuna from the discipline of Journalism, Media, and Communications. A systematic review of all research articles (up until December 2014) from the archives of sixteen journals in the discipline of Journalism, Media, and Communications confirms this lack of attention. Only 0.1 percent of the discipline’s articles are centrally on the field of the press, intelligence agencies, and agenda-building processes, even when these are broadly defined. Patterns within this tiny field are delineated, comprising intelligence agencies’ techniques of, and success in, manipulating different agenda-building nodes involving the press, journalists’ practices and challenges in dealing with intelligence, the public’s role in press-related agenda building on intelligence issues, and methodological patterns and issues in examining this field. The systematic review contextualizes and situates the six research articles comprising this Special Issue.</ab>

        <ab>Survival for the ethnographically-known Kulkalgal of the drought-prone reef islands of central Torres Strait focused on high mobility, translocation, food storage, and importation of cultivated plant foods. These buffering mechanisms were underpinned by a dynamic and flexible web of social alliances and exchange relationships spread across 700 km of seaspace. The small and resource-poor island of Tudu (inhabited by the Tudulgal, a subgroup of the Kulkalgal) was a central place within the regional archipelago polity. It is hypothesised that the Tudulgal strategically increased resource self-sufficiency and orchestrated socio-political dominance to help obviate economic vulnerability. These ethnographic patterns provide the basis for developing archaeological hypotheses on socio-political ascendancy of the Tudulgal, focusing on chronological insights into material dimensions of increasing self-sufficiency (e.g., intensified use of local marine foods, horticultural garden produce, and clam shell technology), and increasing regional domination of exchange (e.g., intensified importation of exotics), canoe trade (e.g., intensified production of shell valuables), and headhunting cults and warfare (e.g., intensified use of skull shrines). While cultural complexity is usually associated with resource-rich coastal contexts and hierarchical societies, the Tudulgal demonstrate that regional polity development and associated socio-political and socio-economic complexity can occur in response to limited availability of critical terrestrial food and water resources in societies that are largely heterarchical and egalitarian.</ab>

        <ab>This paper investigates 'astroturfing' (the creation of armies of 'sockpuppet' personae towards influencing public opinion) in online news comments. Concerns about this practice and its potential impact on public discourse have been voiced in the press, and across a range of disciplines; but it has been little studied in communications and journalism studies. How is online 'astroturfing' in contemporary online news and current affairs defined (operationally); how is it experienced, and what can be done to mitigate it? Given the difficulties attendant to normatively defining astroturfing, discussion shifts to how alternative frameworks in journalism ethics may help journalists challenge this new phenomenon.</ab>

        <ab>Using qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles, Web site matter, and newsprint advertisements, the authors analyze the nuances of Know Your Power ( KYP), a corporate Astroturf campaign created in 2007 to challenge the permitting of the Red Rock coal-fired facility in northern Oklahoma. Employing a risk society framework, the study contributes to literatures on Astroturf campaigns, the social construction and definition of risk, discourse on the contentious politics of energy, and corporate use of false grassroots coalitions in an environmental conflict. Findings indicate that KYP utilized an educational framework, neighborhood expert knowledge, themes central in the risk society, and the impression of a grassroots coalition to convince lay publics and regulatory actors that ' Red Rock is wrong.'</ab>

        <ab>In 2014, an orchestrated campaign of online abuse known as Gamergate overtook the global video game industry, calling unprecedented attention to the scope of gendered harassment on social media. Using Gamergate as an example, this article argues that explanations of online abuse that focus on its cultural or technological dimensions fail to capture the mediating role of online platforms in facilitating and rationalizing harassment and reputational damage. The concept of technological rationality pulls into focus the shared logics that shape platform design and administration as well as practices of online abuse. Proposed solutions to online abuse that fail to address technological rationality will ultimately leave in place the sociotechnical arrangements that make such abuse possible and impactful.</ab>

        <ab>• An astroturfing attack, a form of disinformation, can harm organizations' wellbeing. • An experimental design study empirically tested strategies in response to an attack. • Attitudinal inoculation can pre-bunk disinformation by lowering crisis responsibility. • An attacker's credibility can be lowered with pre-bunking, hindering persuasiveness. • Conceptual framework for proactive responses to disinformation attacks is proposed. Astroturfing, or the orchestration of manipulative propaganda campaigns, has become the center of conversations amid Fake News disputations. Exploring an astroturf attack as a paracrisis, this research investigates the effects of an attack and how proactive communication strategies can protect organizational outcomes (i.e., credibility, crisis responsibility, account acceptance, and organizational reputation). An online experiment using a U.S. adult sample (N = 597) was conducted to compare the effects of using pre-bunking, PR supportive, and strategic silence strategies. The study provides insights into advancing crisis communication theory by demonstrating the success of pre-bunking to thwart potential damage post-astroturf attack. In addition to expanding theoretical crisis response models, this research offers practitioners with advice that emphasizes the use of proactive strategies to pre-bunk disinformation.</ab>

        <ab>Our present world is the culmination of all of humanity's past actions; to understand the present is to understand the past so we can move toward building a better future. Building off this, Chapter 4 discusses climate-specific deflection campaigns in detail as well as the role of social media and bots in altering online discussion about climate change. To this end, Michael Mann aims to educate readers on the historical power dynamics that have enabled the current climate crisis through his book, "The New Climate War", published in January 2021.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have great potential to be used in a wide variety of applications, such as environmental applications, emergency situations and surveillance tasks, among others. However, most current UAS solutions, if not remotely piloted, rely on waypoint based flight control systems for their navigation and are unable to coordinate the aircraft flight with payload operation. We believe that increased automation, together with reconfiguration capabilities and cost-effectiveness, are key requirements for UAS to be successful in a commercial domain. The resulting platform should be affordable and able to operate in different application scenarios with reduced development effort and human intervention. In this paper, an architecture for providing UAS platforms with reconfigurable automated behavior is presented. The desired automation and reconfiguration capabilities are built upon the core sub-systems in that architecture: the Flight Plan Manager and the Mission Manager. Both systems are part of a wider set of embarked services that manage UAS operations during the mission. The Flight Plan Manager and the Mission Manager are respectively responsible for governing the UAS flight and orchestrating operation of other services on-board the UAS. There are two distinct features of the system: firstly, UAS behavior is not hard-coded into its software components, but described using specification formalisms; secondly, the UAS flight path is described by means of an XML based language specifically designed for this purpose. With this approach, flight and payload behavior are described in separate documents that complement each other. Prototype implementations of these services have been implemented and used to validate the proposed specification and execution methods with an application example devoted to the monitoring of wildfires.</ab>

        <ab>Benefit from the efficient energy transfer, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and host-guest recognition as strategies of signal amplification and specific binding have been applied to establish the sensing system; however, the application of these two attractive strategies in one system is rare. Herein, we propose a "turn-on" to "turn-off" fluorescent strategy for sensitive detection of β-galactosidase (β-Gal) based on the application of AIE and host-guest recognition. In this work, a novel red-emitted (635 nm) copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) protected by dithioerythritol (DTE) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) has been found to possess AIE property induced by aluminum cations to achieve the "turn-on" process, and the coordinated behavior between aluminum cations and DTE/β-CD CuNCs is also discussed. As the hydrolysis product of β-Gal and 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, p-nitrophenol can combine with β-CD in DTE/β-CD CuNCs by the host-guest recognition to realize the efficient photoelectron transfer to "turn-off" the fluorescence. This strategy performs the exciting linear range of 0.0–50.0 U/L and detection limit of 0.56 U/L (S/N = 3) for sensitive detection of β-Gal and further applies in biologic samples successfully. As far as we know, this is the first work to combine AIE and host-guest recognition in one system to construct the sensing platform, which can achieve efficient and specific energy transfer to improve the sensitivity of the system. • Combination of AIE and host-guest recognition in one system for β-Gal detection has been established. • The detailed coordinated behavior between aluminum cations and DTE/β-CD CuNCs is also discussed. • The "turn-on"and "turn-off" process have been achieved. • The satisfactory monitor results in determination of β-Gal have been obtained.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: We propose an online algorithm for planning under uncertainty in multi-agent settings modeled as DEC-POMDPs. The algorithm helps overcome the high computational complexity of solving such problems offline. The key challenges in decentralized operation are to maintain coordinated behavior with little or no communication and, when communication is allowed, to optimize value with minimal communication. The algorithm addresses these challenges by generating identical conditional plans based on common knowledge and communicating only when history inconsistency is detected, allowing communication to be postponed when necessary. To be suitable for online operation, the algorithm computes good local policies using a new and fast local search method implemented using linear programming. Moreover, it bounds the amount of memory used at each step and can be applied to problems with arbitrary horizons. The experimental results confirm that the algorithm can solve problems that are too large for the best existing offline planning algorithms and it outperforms the best online method, producing much higher value with much less communication in most cases. The algorithm also proves to be effective when the communication channel is imperfect (periodically unavailable). These results contribute to the scalability of decision-theoretic planning in multi-agent settings.</ab>

        <ab>This essay examines the significance of a particular metaphor, flooding the zone, which gained prominence as an account of bloggers' argumentative prowess in the wake of Senator Trent Lott's toast at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party. I situate the growth of the blogosphere in the context of the political economy of the institutional mass media at the time and argue that the blogosphere is an alternative site for the invention of public argument. By providing an account of how the blogosphere serves as a site of invention by flooding the zone with densely interlinked coverage of a controversy, this essay theorizes how the networked public sphere facilitates invention with speed, agonism, and copiousness. The essay then identifies how flooding the zone has been adopted by corporations and the state in order to blunt spontaneous argumentation emerging flora the periphery of communication networks.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose - To review and critically discuss the current state of privacy in the context of constant technological changes and to emphasize the pace of technological advancements and developments reached over the time when the last EU data protection laws came into effect. These facts inevitably affect the perception of privacy and raise the question of whether privacy is dead or takes the last breath in the digital age? This paper is an attempt to address this question. Design/Methodology/Approach - Based on the comparison and systematic analysis of scientific literature, the authors discuss problematic issues related to privacy and data protection in the technology era - where these issues are too complicated to be clearly regulated by laws and rules since "laws move as a function of years and technology moves as a function of months" (Ron Rivest). Therefore, this analytical approach towards the issue may help to facilitate reaching the best-fit decision in this area. Findings - The authors emphasize the change of perception of privacy, which originated and grew on the idea of "an integral part of our humanity", the "heart of our liberty" and "the beginning of all freedoms" (Solove, 2008), leading to the recently raised idea that privacy is severely hanging with threat. The authors are of the opinion that legislation and regulation may be one of the best and effective techniques for protecting privacy in the twenty-first century, but it is not currently adequate (Wacks, 2012). One of the solutions lies in technology design. Research limitations/implications - The aspects of privacy and data protection in the European Union have been widely discussed recently because of their broad applicability. Therefore, it is hardly possible to review and cover all the important aspects of the issue. This article focuses on the roles of technology and legislation in securing privacy. The authors examine and provide their own views based on the critical analysis of the outstanding scientific material. Practical implications - The authors highlight the ongoing change of perception of privacy. If regulation is left behind the development of technology, privacy will hardly stay alive. On the other hand, if legislation is applied on an ex-ante basis, technological development will depend on the legislators. The balance of both may be the golden means and it basically depends on the coordinated behavior of all the stakeholders. Value - The article emphasizes that the rising role of sharp development of technology by itself does not violate privacy. It is the people using this technology and the policies they carry out that create violations (Garfinkel, 2000). In fact, threats, in the first instance, are the consequences of human behavior. In other words, technology can be a significant factor of violating or demolishing privacy, however, it may also be the major method of protecting it. The balance of both may be the key means.</ab>

        <ab>The view that sponges lack tissue level organisation, epithelia, sensory cells and coordinated behaviour is challenged by recent molecular studies showing the existence in Porifera of molecules and proteins that define cell signalling systems in higher order metazoans. Demonstration that freshwater sponges can contract their canals in an organised manner in response to both external and endogenous stimuli prompted us to examine the physiology of the contraction behaviour. Using a combination of digital time- lapse microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis, immunocytochemistry and pharmacological manipulations, we tested the role of the diffusible amino acids glutamate and y.aminobutyric acid (GABA) and a short-lived diffusible gas, nitric oxide (NO), in triggering or modulating contractions in Ephydatia muelleri. We identified pools of glutamate, glutamine and GABA used to maintain a metabotropic glutamate and GABA receptor signalling system. Glutamate induced contractions and propagation of a stereotypical behaviour inflating and deflating the canal system, acting in a dose- dependent manner. Glutamate-triggered contractions were blocked by the metabatropic glutamate receptor inhibitor AP3 and by incubation of the sponge in an allosteric competitive inhibitor of glutamate, Kynurenic acid. Incubation in GABA inhibited glutamate-triggered contractions of the sponge. Nitric oxide synthase, involved in the formation of the diffusible gas NO, was localised using NADPH-diaphorase to mesenchyme cells in the osculum and pinacoderm. A cGMP assay showed the same cells were labelled suggesting that the NO system is functional. Our findings suggest sponges coordinate behaviour using chemical messenger systems common to other animals.</ab>

        <ab>On February 27, 1973, approximately 200 American Indian Movement (AIM) activists and local residents began an occupation—ultimately to last 71 days—of the village of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, within the boundaries of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. By aggressively raising issues of treaty rights, and the claims of sovereignty for which they stood, the Wounded Knee occupation placed American state authority and national identity in radical question. This paper analyzes the Wounded Knee conflict through the lens of boundaries. It focuses in particular on how the issues of power and authority at the root of the conflict were played out over a series of boundaries that constituted this contested geographic space: what one government official referred to as a ‘protest platform.’ The contentious manner in which questions of authority and power on the Pine Ridge Reservation were played out during the occupation was particularly apparent with respect to the various roadblocks and perimeters that determined who and what had access to Wounded Knee. In broader theoretical and conceptual terms, I argue, while recent use of metaphors such as ‘jumping scales’ and ‘scaling up’ are evocative in characterizing contemporary political spectacles, they can also obscure the actual work that goes into such political statements, both on the part of activists and representatives of the state. As such, they can also obscure the fundamental spatiality of such work.The eyes and the ears of the whole universe are now focused on Wounded Knee. And little Wounded Knee turned into a giant world. Wallace Black Elk, Lakota Medicine Man (in Anderson et al., 1974: 110).The occupying force out there has proclaimed an ‘independent state’ at Wounded Knee. In any other nation this would be called revolution. I haven’t figured out yet what they call it here! .On February 27, 1973, approximately 200 American Indian Movement (AIM) activists and local residents began an occupation—ultimately to last 71 days—of the village of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, within the boundaries of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Within a short time, the Wounded Knee site was surrounded by an impressive show of government force: FBI agents and specially trained federal marshals equipped with high-tech hardware provided, it was only later revealed, by the U.S. Army. Just as importantly, a virtual army of both domestic and international television and print reporters also surrounded the site.As the site of a famous massacre of approximately 300 American Indian men, women and children at the hands of U.S. soldiers in 1890, Wounded Knee was a particularly charged geographic symbol of the violence that accompanied American westward expansion and state building (). By claiming this famous historical site, the occupiers sought to raise awareness of American Indian issues. More specifically and immediately, they sought to bring attention to, and ultimately remove, what they claimed was a corrupt reservation political structure. The occupiers were particularly concerned with the political rule of new Pine Ridge Tribal Chairman Richard (Dick) Wilson, whom they accused of corruption and of aggressively stifling political dissent. Such relatively modest goals, however, were tied into the far grander issue of treaty rights, the boundaries that spatially defined those rights, and the claims of sovereignty for which they stood. As such, the occupation questioned the very basis on which the most powerful nationstate in the world existed. Not unlike more recent events like those which occurred in Waco, Texas () or the political spectacle that surrounded the case of Elia´n Gonza´lez in Miami, the Wounded Knee occupation placed American state authority and national identity in radical question.To make this point in clear language, on March 10th the Wounded Knee occupiers declared a new state: the Independent Oglala Nation (ION). The boundaries that defined this contested site were now declared ‘borders,’ whose status was to be aggressively maintained by a ‘border patrol.’ With dramatic images of Indian ‘warriors’ manning their bunkers to protect this territory gracing the pages of major national magazines like Newsweek and Time () and the screens of primetime television, the Wounded Knee occupation was an early example the power of mediated protest. Wounded Knee was what one commentator at the time referred to as “a test-tube case of confrontation politics and its symbiosis with the media” (: 8), and what critics referred to as an example of ‘guerrilla theater.’ Writing in the Nation, for example, : 806) lamented that Wounded Knee constituted “an example of a new and expanding strategy of political manipulation that neatly circumvents the ordinary process of government [and] makes a direct and powerful appeal to the public through the mass media.” Through AIM’s successful ‘media coup’—in which reporters from all of the major news organizations in the U.S., as well as a significant foreign contingent, quickly rushed to the scene of the story—Wounded Knee became “[o]vernight ... the national headline and Washington found AIM’s media gun pointed at its head” (: 808).The Wounded Knee occupation was noted for its spectacular symbolic politics, in which issues of treaty rights and the sovereignty claims for which they stood were articulated, in quite dramatic fashion, on a global media stage. Because of this, the occupation also attracted the intense interest of the federal government, which responded with one of the most significant deployments of American state power in domestic space in the 20th century. For the White House, the Wounded Knee occupation was an issue of national concern. While senior Washington officials tried to ‘low-key’ the incident, as Attorney General Kleindienst put it early in the occupation (Kleindienst, 1979: 268), they recognized their authority and responsibility to do so in the ‘national interest.’ Particularly as media coverage and pubic attention raised the profile of the occupation, senior Washington officials insisted on a policy of restraint. In spatial terms, this policy was manifested in a strategy of containment. Rather than forcibly remove the occupiers, federal forces worked to limit the movement of people, things, and images back and forth across the boundary that defined the occupation site. Yet just as the conduct of the drawn-out occupation was fluid and changeable, so too was the status of the various boundaries that constituted the spatial form of this political spectacle. The contentious manner in which questions of authority and power on the Pine Ridge Reservation were played out during the occupation was particularly apparent with respect to the various roadblocks and perimeters that determined who and what had access to Wounded Knee.In this paper, I analyze the complex geographical dynamics of this political event. By drawing, in particular, on the large collection of FBI documents made publicly available in the years since the occupation, I am able to explain the actions and motivations of various state officials as they worked to manage a significant challenge to their authority. As a relatively early example of a televised protest—and because of the large number of documents available on the event—the Wounded Knee occupation sheds important light on the geographical dynamics of contemporary mass-mediated protest, and on how states act in the context of such political spectacles. This paper focuses in particular on how the issues of power and authority at the root of the conflict were played out over a series of boundaries that constituted this contested geographic space: what one government official referred to as a ‘protest platform.’ Such analysis, I argue, allows insight not just into this important historical event, but also broader issues of contemporary political protest and state power.</ab>

        <ab>Abstract: Simultaneous recording of behavioral and functional data is crucial in capturing the neural mechanisms underpinning human motor actions. We describe a non-magnetic equipment (NME) to record finger kinematics, in particular the absolute amplitude of finger oscillation, during bimanual coordination paradigms performed in functional studies. NME monitors finger movements with optic fiber signals that are post-processed off-line to quantify finger kinematics. A phantom experiment demonstrated no mutual interference between NME and fMRI, hence the usability of NME in environments sensitive to electro-magnetic fields. The spatial and temporal resolutions of NME data (1mm and 1ms), its reliability and feasibility when studying human subjects were verified with two comparative experiments performed with NME and a validated infrared camera (IRC) system. Results showed that the restrictions of NME (reduction of degrees of freedom of the coordinated system and potential haptic feedback) do not interfere with the correct reconstruction of finger kinematics. We also demonstrated that the recorded behavioral information can be used to detect neural activity associated with specific features of coordinated behavior. Therefore, we believe that the use of NME for the combined analysis of behavioral and functional data may help assessing an adequate interpretation of the cortical activity associated with specific tasks. This approach might as well help to explore the role of specific brain areas in motor processes, with a potential great impact in the diagnosis and subsequent intervention in brain injured patients, or in children affected by developmental coordination disorders.</ab>

        <ab>Price is a central analytic concept in both neoclassical and old institutional economics. Combining the social network perspective with old and new institutionalist approaches to price formation, this article examines technological, economic, institutional, and political factors that shaped the earliest pricing systems for electricity used in the United States, between 1882 and 1910. We show that certain characteristics of electricity supply led to ambiguities in how the product should be priced, which created a politics of pricing among electricity producers. In particular, we investigate why the “Wright system,” arguably inferior in productive efficiency to other alternatives, was widely adopted by 1900. We argue that this outcome resulted in part from the political and organizational clout of its supporters, as well as from their particular conceptions of the boundaries and future of the industry itself. The Wright system best suited the “growth dynamic” strategy promoted by the managers of large central stations in their fierce competition with smaller and more decentralized installations. Thus, even in this apparently highly technical and mainly economic issue of how to price the product, there was ample room for social construction and political manipulation. The outcome reached was by no means inevitable and had a highly significant impact on the shape of the American industrial infrastructure.</ab>

        <ab>The study explores political communication to uncover how the media, and within it the press, tries to manipulate its audience also using translation as a tool to this end. The paper discusses crucial aspects of mediatised communication including reality, the presentation of reality as well as political and party bias. It will be argued that these factors can be incorporated in a theoretical model to assess bias and reality-related aspects of mediatised texts and their translations. The study will conclude by introducing a purely theoretical model, the Translation-centred Political Mass Communication Analytical Model, which facilitates the analysis of source and target texts used in the context of political mass communication.</ab>

        <ab>This paper utilises Hall's (1977) 'encoding-decoding' theory in the context of critical political economy theories of the media and cultural studies to explain the political, economic and cultural factors that influence media operation and content both at a macro and micro level. While political economy provides the setting in which the Kenyan media operates, cultural studies show how media content is not only shaped by the political and economic environments comprising those in power positions. Audiences are also actively engaged in the process of meaning construction. Considering Hall's (1977) encoding-decoding theory, the audiences can reject, negotiate or accept media content based on their own value systems and cultural orientation. Meaning, therefore, becomes a product of continual struggle between different discourses and power cannot be located in a top down manner as to who influences meaning as seen in a propaganda model. This is due to the fact that texts are diffused in different locations in society. The 2008 Kenya Communication Bill is utilised as an example to trace briefly the political and historical developments of policy issues that have influenced the Kenyan media. The Bill, furthermore, indicates how a weak socio-economic, political and cultural environment is marred by ineffectual policies meant to safeguard and guarantee the freedom of the press as an extension of individual freedom of expression as enshrined in the Kenyan constitution. This weak policy context has ensured the Kenyan media remains subject to easy political manipulation and control. However, the paper concludes by showing how citizen journalism is growing out of a regulated mainstream media through internet technology.</ab>

        <ab>The article offers the author's insights on the role of media in the elimination of inconvenient leaders. He mentions former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as example and says that the toppling of Hussein's regime shows the use of medium-sized and little lies, war through Twitter, and proxies to renounce the leadership. He adds that in the case of former Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi shows the efficiency of disinformation campaign to isolate him and bring domestic grievances.</ab>

        <ab>Drawing from feminist legal theory, research into computer intermediated discourse, and cultural studies, this paper looks at the impact of search engines and user generated Internet content on the construction of gender and sex in cyberspace. Ways in which the structures and norms of Internet searching and content generation may ultimately re-order specific areas of the law in will be addressed, as will the impact of anonymously or pseudonymously authored source material, and online activities colloquially termed "astroturfing" and "sockpuppeting," with an explicit focus on important issues of gender and sexuality. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript</ab>

        <ab>The article speculates on the man who the Russian government will put forward for citizens to approve as the successor of President Vladimir Putin. It elaborates the notion that somehow Putin is all that stands between the West and an atavistic Russia. It highlights a book by Andrew Wilson on the post-Soviet art of political manipulation, entitled "Virtual Politics: Faking Democracy in the Post-Soviet World." It addresses an expansion of private power and corporate power within Putin's inner circle.</ab>

        <ab>The author argues that the proposed Royal Charter in Great Britain could undermine press freedom and independence. She raises concern about the charter being open to political manipulation as it does not propose a system of direct regulation of the press by politician. She notes the differences between the charter of the British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) and draft Royal Charter. She points out the failure of politicians to allay the concerns of the press to gain acceptance of the Royal Charter.</ab>

        <ab>Background. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke adversely affects maternal and child health. Secondhand smoke (SHS) has been linked causally with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in major health reports. In 1992, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first noted an association between SHS and SIDS, and both prenatal exposure and postnatal SHS exposure were listed as independent risk factors for SIDS in a 1997 California EPA report (republished in 1999 by the National Cancer Institute) and a 2004 US Surgeon General report.The tobacco industry has used scientific consultants to attack the evidence that SHS causes disease, most often lung cancer. Little is known about the industry's strategies to contest the evidence on maternal and child health. In 2001, a review was published on SIDS that acknowledged funding from the Philip Morris (PM) tobacco company. Tobacco industry documents related to this review were examined to identify the company's influence on the content and conclusions of this review.Methods. Tobacco industry documents include 40 million pages of internal memos and reports made available to the public as a result of litigation settlements against the tobacco industry in the United States. Between November 2003 and January 2004, we searched tobacco industry document Internet sites from the University of California Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and the Tobacco Documents Online website. Key terms included 'SIDS' and names of key persons. Two authors conducted independent searches with similar key terms, reviewed the documents, and agreed on relevancy through consensus. Thirty documents were identified as relevant. Two drafts (an early version and a final version) of an industry-funded review article on SIDS were identified, and 2 authors independently compared these drafts with the final publication. Formal comments by PM executives made in response to the first draft were also reviewed. We used Science Citation Index in July 2004 to determine citation patterns for the referenced SIDS reviews.Results. PM executives feared that SHS and maternal and child health issues would create a powerful and emotional impetus for smoke-free areas in the home, public areas, and the workplace. In response to the 1992 US EPA report on SHS, the Science and Technology Department of PM's Switzerland subsidiary, Fabriques de Tabac Reunies, searched for 'independent' consultants to publish articles addressing SHS. The first industry-funded article was a literature review focusing on smoking and SIDS, conducted by consultant Peter Lee and co-author Allison Thornton, which stated that the association between parental smoking and SIDS could have been attributable to the failure to control fully for confounders. That first review has only been cited once, in the subsequent industry-funded review.In 1997, PM commissioned a consultant, Frank Sullivan, to write a review, with coauthor Susan Barlow, of all possible risk factors for SIDS. The first draft concluded that prenatal and postnatal smoking exposures are both independent risk factors for SIDS. After receiving comments and meeting with PM scientific executives, Sullivan changed his original conclusions on smoking and SIDS. The final draft was changed to emphasize the effects of prenatal maternal smoking and to conclude that postnatal SHS effects were 'less well established.' Changes in the draft to support this new conclusion included descriptions of Peter Lee's industry-funded review, a 1999 negative but underpowered study of SIDS risk and urinary cotinine levels, and criticisms of the conclusions of the National Cancer Institute report that SHS was causally associated with SIDS. In April 2001, the Sullivan review was published in the United Kingdom journal Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, with a disclosure statement that acknowledged financial support from PM but did not acknowledge contributions from PM executives in the preparation of the review. By 2004, the Sullivan SIDS review had been cited at least 19 times in the medical literature.Conclusions. PM executives responded to corporate concerns about the possible adverse effects of SHS on maternal and child health by commissioning consultants to write review articles for publication in the medical literature. PM executives successfully encouraged one author to change his original conclusion that SHS is an independent risk factor for SIDS to state that the role of SHS is 'less well established.' These statements are consistent with PM's corporate position that active smoking causes disease but only public health officials conclude the same for SHS. The author's disclosure of industry funding did not reveal the full extent of PM's involvement in shaping the content of the article. This analysis suggests that accepting tobacco industry funds can disrupt the integrity of the scientific process.The background of this SIDS review is relevant for institutions engaged in the debate about accepting or eschewing funding from the tobacco industry. Those who support acceptance of tobacco industry funds argue that academic authors retain the right to publish their work and maintain final approval of the written product, but this argument fails to recognize that the tobacco industry funds work to ensure that messages favorable to the industry are published and disseminated.Clinicians, parents, and public health officials are most vulnerable to the changed conclusions of the SIDS review. The national SIDS 'Back to Sleep' campaign has been very successful in reducing SIDS rates. However, estimates of SIDS risk from SHS (odds ratios range from 1.4 to 5.1) have considerable overlap with estimates of risk from prone sleep positioning (odds ratios range from 1.7 to 12.9). With the Back to Sleep campaign well underway, efforts to address parental smoking behavior in both the prenatal and postnatal periods should be intensified. The tobacco industry's disinformation campaign on SHS and maternal and child health can be counteracted within clinicians' offices.</ab>

        <ab>THERE are all sorts of strange characters pitching products on television, among them a jovial giant, as green as the vegetables he peddles; a bald man in a white T-shirt, obsessed with cleanliness; and an insurance-loving lizard with a Cockney accent. Now their ranks are being joined by a sensual female robot from the future who adores vodka. The so-called fembot is the character for Svedka, an increasingly popular vodka brand imported from Sweden, which is taking to television advertising for the first time. The initial TV commercial, which will double as a video clip online, is part of a new campaign for Svedka, created internally, that carries the theme ''R.U. Bot or Not?''</ab>

Burger King Corp. experimented with a web site 'www.subseivientchicken.com,' for quirky marketing and then the Web site www.AngusDiet.com,' to promote the sale of Angus beef burger.
